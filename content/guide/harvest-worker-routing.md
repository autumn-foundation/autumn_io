# Worker routing and capabilities



As your workflow fleet grows, tasks often need to run on specific hardware, in specific regions, or on nodes with specific permissions. For example, a video transcoding activity might require a GPU, while a data syncing activity must run in `us-west-2` to minimize egress costs.

Harvest provides three primary mechanisms for routing tasks to the right workers:

1. **Queue name partitioning** (separating workers onto different queues).
2. **Build-ID routing** (version-based compatibility gates).
3. **Worker capability labels and activity requirements** (hardware/region-aware routing within a single queue).

---

## Routing Pattern Comparison

| Mechanism | Best for… | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Queue Partitioning** | Coarse-grained thread pool separation (e.g. `high-cpu` vs `io-bound`). | Simple setup; isolated database locks per queue. | Queue name explosion if used for fine-grained attributes (e.g., `gpu-useast1-v4`). |
| **Build-ID Routing** | Blue-green deployments, rolling releases, and retirement gates. | Automated compatibility checking; deterministic version gates. | Designed for deployment versions, not static hardware properties. |
| **Capability Labels** | Fine-grained static capabilities (e.g. `gpu = true`, `region in [us-east-1]`). | No queue name explosion; filters at database claim-time; in-memory activity requirements. | Requires restarting the worker to update labels. |

## Worker Capability Labels

Instead of creating separate task queues for every combination of hardware and location, you can assign **capability labels** to workers and declare **requirements** on activities. The scheduler automatically gates task delivery at claim time, ensuring workers only receive tasks they are capable of running.

### 1. Declaring Activity Requirements

Activity requirements are defined using the `requires` parameter on the `#[activity]` macro. Harvest parses these requirements in a clean, declarative syntax supporting exact matches (`=`) and set membership (`in`).

```rust
use autumn_harvest::prelude::*;

// Requires a GPU-enabled worker in either us-east-1 or us-west-2
#[activity(
    start_to_close = "10m",
    queue = "transcoding",
    requires = "gpu = true, region in [us-east-1, us-west-2]"
)]
async fn transcode_video(ctx: &ActivityContext, input: TranscodeInput) -> HarvestResult<TranscodeOutput> {
    // Transcoding logic...
    Ok(TranscodeOutput::default())
}
```

### 2. Configuring Worker Capability Labels

Workers publish their labels when registering with the fleet. Configure these labels on the `WorkerConfig` builder:

```rust
use autumn_harvest::WorkerConfig;

let mut labels = std::collections::HashMap::new();
labels.insert("gpu".to_string(), "true".to_string());
labels.insert("region".to_string(), "us-east-1".to_string());

let config = WorkerConfig::default()
    .with_labels(labels);
```

Or programmatically add individual labels:

```rust
let config = WorkerConfig::default()
    .with_label("gpu", "true")
    .with_label("region", "us-east-1");
```

---

## Under the Hood: Claim-Time Filtering

To keep database queries fast and scalable, activity requirements are stored in the worker's handler registry rather than persisted in the database.

1. **Ineligible List Generation**: At boot, the worker evaluates its registered activities against its configured capability labels. Any activity whose requirements are *not* satisfied is added to the worker's `ineligible_activities` list.
2. **Claim Gating**: When polling for tasks, the worker passes its `ineligible_activities` array to the `claim_task` database query. The scheduler uses a `SKIP LOCKED` query with an additive filter:
   ```sql
   AND (
       task_type != 'activity'
       OR activity_name IS NULL
       OR NOT (activity_name = ANY($6))
   )
   ```
   This prevents the worker from ever locking or claiming a task it is not equipped to execute, leaving it available for capable workers.

---

## Monitoring and Triage

When tasks seem stuck, you can inspect the fleet capability state using the dashboard, CLI, or HTTP endpoints.

### Query Capable Workers
To find out which workers can run a specific activity, use the `capable_of` parameter:

```bash
# HTTP API
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/harvest/workers?capable_of=transcode_video" | jq .

# CLI
harvest worker list --capable-of transcode_video
```

### Eligibility Triage
If an activity is PENDING and no workers are claiming it, check the queue eligibility endpoint:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/harvest/admin/queues/transcoding/eligibility" | jq .
```

The response lists ineligible workers and the exact unsatisfied requirement:

```json
{
  "queue_name": "transcoding",
  "pending_tasks_count": 5,
  "eligible_workers": [
    {
      "worker_id": "worker-gpu-node-1",
      "labels": {"gpu": "true", "region": "us-east-1"}
    }
  ],
  "ineligible_workers": [
    {
      "worker_id": "worker-cpu-node-2",
      "labels": {"region": "us-east-1"},
      "reasons": ["unsatisfied_requirement:gpu=true"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Multi-queue Worker Fairness (issue #515)

A single Harvest worker can bind multiple task queues via `WorkerConfig.with_queues`.
Without further configuration the worker passes all queues to a single `SKIP LOCKED`
SQL query, so a high-volume bulk queue can monopolize concurrency slots and starve a
latency-sensitive queue on the same worker.

**Per-queue weights** give operators static control over the dispatch split without
running a separate worker process per queue.

### Configuring weights

```rust
WorkerConfig::default()
    .with_queues(["nightly-export", "user-email"])
    .with_queue_weights([
        ("nightly-export", 1u32),
        ("user-email",     3u32),
    ])
```

With a 3:1 weight, `user-email` tasks are dispatched approximately three times as
often as `nightly-export` tasks under sustained saturation of both queues.

### Weight semantics

| Weight | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `> 0`  | Relative dispatch probability. `weight_i / Σ(all_weights)` is the fraction of poll iterations where queue *i* is tried first. |
| `0`    | Fallthrough-only. The queue is only drained when every positive-weight queue has no available work. |
| absent | Treated as weight **1** — equal share with other un-weighted queues. |

### Default behaviour is unchanged

`with_queue_weights` is opt-in. Workers that do not call it continue to use the
original single `ANY($queues)` SQL query — byte-for-byte identical to previous
behaviour. There are **zero** new `WorkflowEvent` variants, **zero** migrations,
and **zero** shard-semantics changes.

### No-starvation guarantee

The selection algorithm produces a **permutation** of all non-zero-weight queues
on every poll iteration. The worker walks that permutation and dispatches from the
first queue that has an available task. Because every queue appears exactly once in
the permutation, any queue with available work and a non-zero weight always makes
forward progress, even while heavier queues are saturated.

Zero-weight queues appear at the end of the permutation, so they are reachable as
soon as all positive-weight queues are drained.

### Composition with within-queue priority (#249)

Weights decide **which queue** to claim from. Once a queue is selected, the
standard `ORDER BY priority DESC, scheduled_at ASC` SQL ordering picks the best
row within that queue — fully unchanged.

### Observability

Each dispatched task increments the `harvest.queue.dispatched{queue}` counter
(available via `MetricsRecorder::record_task_dispatched`). Plot this counter per
queue to confirm the live dispatch split matches your configured weights.

```promql
# Fraction of dispatches going to user-email
rate(harvest_queue_dispatched_total{queue="user-email"}[5m])
  /
rate(harvest_queue_dispatched_total[5m])
```

### Scope

Per-worker-process only. Cross-worker or fleet-global queue weighting is out of
scope. Cross-shard fairness is explicitly a non-goal per `docs/sharding.md`.

**Performance note:** the weighted path makes up to N sequential `claim_task`
database round-trips per poll (one per queue in permutation order, stopping on
the first hit), versus 1 round-trip for the default `ANY($queues)` path. With
2–5 queues and typical poll intervals of 100–500 ms this overhead is negligible.
If `poll_interval` P99 latency is a concern, benchmark with and without weights
before deploying.
