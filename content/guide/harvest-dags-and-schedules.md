# DAGs and schedules



Workflows are the right shape when one orchestration drives a sequence of
steps tied to a single business event (one checkout, one signup, one
upload). Some work isn't shaped like that — it's a *graph* of activities
with fan-out, fan-in, and conditional rerun rules, run on a cron. Think
nightly reconciliation, ETL pipelines, daily report generation.

Harvest models that with **DAGs**: a directed acyclic graph of activities
declared with the `#[dag]` macro, scheduled by the engine, and executed
through the same task queue as everything else.

## Declaring a DAG

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use autumn_harvest::prelude::*;

#[activity(start_to_close = "5m", queue = "ops")]
async fn export_billing_events(_ctx: &ActivityContext, _input: serde_json::Value)
    -> HarvestResult<serde_json::Value>
{
    // … pull yesterday's events into the warehouse
    Ok(serde_json::json!({ "rows": 12_345 }))
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "10m", queue = "ops")]
async fn reconcile_gateway(_ctx: &ActivityContext, _input: serde_json::Value)
    -> HarvestResult<serde_json::Value>
{
    // … diff our records against the payment gateway
    Ok(serde_json::json!({ "discrepancies": 0 }))
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "1m", queue = "ops")]
async fn notify_finance(_ctx: &ActivityContext, _input: serde_json::Value)
    -> HarvestResult<serde_json::Value>
{
    // … email finance with the result, success or failure
    Ok(serde_json::Value::Null)
}

#[dag(
    schedule = "0 6 * * *",       // every day at 06:00
    catchup = false,              // skip missed runs after downtime
    max_active_runs = 1,          // never overlap two runs of this DAG
    default_queue = "ops",
)]
pub fn billing_reconciliation(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    let export = dag.activity(export_billing_events);

    let reconcile = dag
        .activity(reconcile_gateway)
        .upstream(&export)
        .retry(RetryPolicy::fixed(3, Duration::from_secs(30)));

    let _notify = dag
        .activity(notify_finance)
        .upstream(&reconcile)
        .trigger_rule(TriggerRule::AllDone);
}
```

That's the whole vocabulary. Three things to notice:

- **`#[dag]` is on a `pub fn`, not `async fn`.** The function describes the
  graph; it does not execute it. The engine calls it once at registration
  to build the `DagDefinition`, then runs that definition on each scheduled
  tick.
- **`dag.activity(f)` returns a `DagTaskRef`.** That handle exposes
  `.upstream(&other)`, `.trigger_rule(...)`, `.retry(...)`,
  `.start_to_close(...)`, and `.queue(...)` for chaining task-level
  overrides. Activity-level attributes from `#[activity]` are inherited as
  defaults and can be overridden per task.
- **`notify_finance` runs even if `reconcile` fails.** That's what
  `TriggerRule::AllDone` means: fire when every upstream has reached a
  terminal state, regardless of outcome. Useful for end-of-pipeline
  notification and cleanup.

## Dynamic Task Mapping (Fan-Out)

Sometimes, the width of the graph isn't known at design time. You might query a database for a list of partition IDs, and then want to process each partition in parallel.

Harvest supports **dynamic task mapping** (issue #485). A mapped task maps over an upstream task that returns a JSON array, executing one concurrent instance of the activity for each element in the array.

### Declaring a Mapped Task

Use `dag.map_activity` and chain `.over(&upstream)` to bind the fan-out to the upstream task:

```rust
#[activity]
async fn list_partitions(_ctx: &ActivityContext) -> HarvestResult<Vec<String>> {
    Ok(vec!["p0".into(), "p1".into(), "p2".into()])
}

#[activity]
async fn process_partition(_ctx: &ActivityContext, partition: String) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    // Process single partition...
    Ok(serde_json::Value::Null)
}

#[activity]
async fn combine_results(_ctx: &ActivityContext, results: Vec<Value>) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    // Downstream collect task receives the gathered array
    Ok(serde_json::Value::Null)
}

#[dag]
pub fn partition_etl(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    // 1. Upstream node produces a JSON array
    let list = dag.activity(list_partitions);

    // 2. Mapped node fans out over the array in parallel
    let process = dag.map_activity(process_partition).over(&list);

    // 3. Downstream collect node receives the array of results
    let _combine = dag.activity(combine_results).upstream(&process);
}
```

### Failure Policies

By default, mapped nodes use the `FailFast` failure policy. You can override it via `.map_failure_policy(...)`:

```rust
let process = dag.map_activity(process_partition)
    .over(&list)
    .map_failure_policy(MapFailurePolicy::CollectAll);
```

| Policy | Behavior | Downstream Input |
|---|---|---|
| `FailFast` *(default)* | The **first** cell failure fails the mapped task; later cell failures do not change the outcome. Instances already dispatched are **drained** (awaited to completion), not cancelled — see below. | Downstream does not run (unless trigger rule permits). |
| `CollectAll` | Execute all N instances to completion. Gathers outcomes for all slots into a status array. Mapped task succeeds. | Downstream receives array of outcome objects: `[{"status":"succeeded","value":v}, {"status":"failed","error":"err"}]`. |

`FailFast` names *outcome* semantics, not cancellation: the first cell failure
decides the node's result and stops **downstream** work, but every cell already
dispatched runs to completion. A mapped cell is a durable `harvest_task_queue`
row, so it was never cancellable by the workflow abandoning its future — the
in-flight instances always ran regardless. The mapped node now waits for them
before the DAG terminates, which also keeps the replay cursor clean for the
issue #780 compensation unwind. Choose `FailFast` for "don't run the rest of the
graph", not for bounded failure latency or to prevent already-dispatched cells
from completing.

### Behavior and Guarantees

- **Empty Arrays (N = 0)**: If the upstream returns `[]`, the mapped task completes immediately as a successful no-op. Downstream collect nodes receive `[]` and still fire.
- **Replay Determinism**: The fanned-out width N is a pure function of recorded upstream outputs. During replay, Harvest validates that the number of scheduled instances matches the runtime length of the array. If N differs on replay, Harvest halts execution with a `NonDeterministic` error.

## Under the hood — unified execution

Since Harvest 0.3 (`unified-dag-execution` feature, on by default), `#[dag]`
functions are executed as *workflows* on the standard workflow execution path
rather than through a bespoke DAG executor.  The macro lowers the graph
definition into a `WorkflowHandlerFn` that walks `DagDefinition` level by
level and dispatches each activity through `ctx.execute_activity_raw`, so DAG
runs show up as workflow executions in `harvest_workflow_executions`, benefit
from the same replay-safe history model, and are observable through all the
same tooling.

You do **not** need to register the underlying workflow manually —
`HarvestPlugin::dags(dags![my_dag])` auto-registers the `WorkflowInfo` and
(if the DAG has a `schedule = "..."` attribute) the `WorkflowSchedule` for
you.

## `#[dag]` attributes

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule` | none (manual) | Cron expression — `"0 6 * * *"`, `"*/15 * * * *"`. Omit for manual-trigger-only DAGs. |
| `catchup` | `false` | If `true`, the scheduler enqueues a run for every interval missed during downtime. If `false`, only the next-scheduled run runs after a gap. |
| `max_active_runs` | `1` | Cap on concurrent runs of the same DAG. Set higher for fast-cadence DAGs whose runs can safely overlap. |
| `default_queue` | `"default"` | Queue assigned to tasks that don't override it via `#[activity(queue = ...)]` or `.queue(...)`. |
| `execution_timeout` | none | Hard wall-clock deadline for the whole DAG run — see below. |
| `sla` | none | Soft SLA for the whole DAG run — see below. |

### Deadlines for scheduled DAG runs (`execution_timeout` / `sla`)

A unified DAG (the default execution mode — see "Under the hood" above) is
just a `#[workflow]` under the hood, so it can declare the same hard
`execution_timeout` and soft `sla` a plain workflow does:

```rust
#[dag(schedule = "0 6 * * *", execution_timeout = "4h", sla = "3h")]
fn nightly_etl(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    let extract = dag.activity(extract_users);
    let _load = dag.activity(load_warehouse).upstream(&extract);
}
```

`execution_timeout` and `sla` are propagated **verbatim** onto the DAG's
shadow `WorkflowInfo` (`DagInfo::as_workflow_info`) and enforced by the
**same** scanners a plain `#[workflow(execution_timeout = "…", sla = "…")]`
already uses — the existing execution-timeout scanner
(`timeout::enforce_workflow_execution_timeouts`) and the existing soft-SLA
scanner (`timeout::enforce_workflow_sla_breaches`). There is no separate
DAG-specific deadline mechanism, no new `WorkflowEvent` variant, and no new
migration: a DAG run that overruns `execution_timeout` transitions to
`TIMED_OUT` exactly like an overrun plain workflow, and a run that passes its
`sla` emits `harvest.workflow.sla_breached{workflow, queue}` once and keeps
running. See "Soft SLA" and "SLA vs `execution_timeout`" in
[`07-reliability-knobs.md`](/docs/harvest-reliability-knobs) for the full semantics
(clamping, pause interaction, the fleet-wide
`HarvestBuilder::max_workflow_execution_timeout(…)` ceiling) — they apply to a
DAG's declared values identically. In particular: if `sla` is declared larger
than `execution_timeout`, it is **clamped down** to `execution_timeout` at
start (the hard timeout would kill the run before the soft signal could ever
fire), and the builder-wide ceiling caps a DAG's declared
`execution_timeout` exactly as it caps a plain workflow's.

A DAG declaring neither attribute behaves exactly as before — `null`
`deadline_at`/`sla_deadline_at`, no scanner interaction, zero regression.
`GET /admin/schedules` surfaces the schedule's *effective* deadlines
(`execution_timeout_secs`/`sla_secs`, already clamped) resolved from the
registered workflow or the DAG's shadow `WorkflowInfo`, so an operator can see
what a scheduled DAG's next fire will get without cross-referencing source.

(Classic, non-unified DAGs — `workflow_handler: None` — are already rejected
at plugin startup and are being retired; `execution_timeout`/`sla` are a
unified-DAG-only feature by construction, since the shadow `WorkflowInfo`
that carries them only exists for unified DAGs.)

## Trigger rules

`TriggerRule` decides whether a downstream task fires given the terminal
states of its upstream tasks:

| Rule | Fire when |
|---|---|
| `AllSuccess` *(default)* | Every upstream succeeded. |
| `AllDone` | Every upstream reached a terminal state, success or failure. |
| `OneSuccess` | At least one upstream succeeded. |
| `OneFailed` | At least one upstream failed. |
| `AllFailed` | Every upstream failed. |
| `Manual` | Never auto-fire — the operator triggers the task explicitly. |

`AllDone` is the right choice for notification, cleanup, and metric-emit
tasks. `OneSuccess` is the "fan-in for any successful branch" shape.
`OneFailed` is the "alert on first failure" shape.

## Data-dependent branching

Trigger rules gate a node on the *state* of its upstreams (succeeded,
failed, skipped). Sometimes you need to route on the upstream's *output
value* — "if `fraud_score > 0.8`, run manual review; otherwise
auto-approve." That's what **condition predicates** do.

Call `.condition(|outputs| …)` on a `DagTaskRef`. The closure receives a
slice of `serde_json::Value` — one element per upstream output, in the
order the upstreams were declared. If it returns `false`, the node is
skipped; the skip propagates downstream through the normal trigger-rule
inference (so an `AllSuccess` child of a skipped node is also skipped, and
an `AllDone` join that receives all skips still fires).

### Fraud-routing example

```rust
use serde_json::Value;
use autumn_harvest::prelude::*;

#[activity(start_to_close = "30s")]
async fn score_payment(ctx: &ActivityContext, input: Value) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    // Returns {"score": 0.0–1.0}
    Ok(serde_json::json!({ "score": 0.92 }))
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "5m")]
async fn manual_review(ctx: &ActivityContext, input: Value) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    Ok(Value::Null)
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "5s")]
async fn auto_approve(ctx: &ActivityContext, input: Value) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    Ok(Value::Null)
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "30s")]
async fn notify_result(ctx: &ActivityContext, input: Value) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    Ok(Value::Null)
}

#[dag(schedule = "*/5 * * * *")]
pub fn fraud_routing(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    // Step 1: score the payment.
    let score = dag.activity(score_payment);

    // Step 2a: manual review only when score is high.
    let review = dag
        .activity(manual_review)
        .upstream(&score)
        .condition(|outputs| {
            outputs[0]["score"].as_f64().unwrap_or(0.0) > 0.8
        });

    // Step 2b: auto-approve only when score is low.
    let approve = dag
        .activity(auto_approve)
        .upstream(&score)
        .condition(|outputs| {
            outputs[0]["score"].as_f64().unwrap_or(0.0) <= 0.8
        });

    // Step 3: join — AllDone so it fires regardless of which branch ran.
    let _notify = dag
        .activity(notify_result)
        .upstream(&review)
        .upstream(&approve)
        .trigger_rule(TriggerRule::AllDone);
}
```

At each run exactly one of `manual_review` / `auto_approve` executes; the
other is skipped. `notify_result` sees two upstreams — one succeeded, one
skipped — so `AllDone` fires. If you use `AllSuccess` there instead,
`notify_result` would also be skipped (skipped is not succeeded).

### N-way switch

Conditions are plain Rust closures, so multi-way routing is just multiple
tasks with mutually-exclusive predicates:

```rust
#[dag]
pub fn risk_triage(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    let score = dag.activity(score_payment);

    let _low = dag.activity(low_risk_path).upstream(&score)
        .condition(|o| o[0]["score"].as_f64().unwrap_or(0.0) < 0.3);

    let _medium = dag.activity(medium_risk_path).upstream(&score)
        .condition(|o| {
            let s = o[0]["score"].as_f64().unwrap_or(0.0);
            (0.3..0.8).contains(&s)
        });

    let _high = dag.activity(high_risk_path).upstream(&score)
        .condition(|o| o[0]["score"].as_f64().unwrap_or(0.0) >= 0.8);
}
```

Exactly one branch runs per execution. The engine evaluates each condition
independently — a task is skipped when *its* condition returns `false`,
regardless of what any sibling condition returned.

### Conditions on mapped tasks

`.condition(…)` is available on `DagMapTaskRef` (returned by
`dag.map_activity(…).over(&upstream)`) and works the same way: if the
condition is false, the entire mapped fan-out is skipped as a unit.

### Determinism rule

The predicate is a **pure function of upstream outputs**. Those outputs are
already frozen in `harvest_events` when the condition runs, so the same
closure call produces the same result on every replay — as long as the
closure only reads the `outputs` slice and nothing else. Do not read
process state, the system clock, or random values inside a condition
closure; use [`ctx.side_effect`](/docs/harvest-reliability-knobs) in an upstream
activity instead and read the recorded value through its output.

### Vantage UI and observability

The Vantage DAG detail page distinguishes two skip reasons:

| Display text | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *Skipped (upstream)* | Node skipped because a trigger rule was not satisfied. |
| *Skipped (condition)* | Node skipped because its condition predicate returned `false`. |

A `MarkerRecorded` event named `dag_skip:{N}` (where *N* is the zero-based
task index) is appended to the execution history for every condition-skip.
This event appears on the execution timeline page and can be queried
directly from `harvest_events`. Trigger-rule skips emit no marker, so
pre-existing DAG histories replay unchanged.

### Simulator note

The offline DAG simulator (`autumn_harvest::dag_simulator`) treats all
nodes as runnable for the purpose of structure validation — it does not
evaluate condition closures. Use `WorkflowTestEnv` or a real run to verify
routing behaviour.

## Passing data between nodes (node input binding)

By default, every DAG node's activity is fed the DAG's *trigger input*
(wrapped in a `{ "conf": …, "dag_task": "<name>" }` envelope) — **not** the
output of the upstream node it depends on. So a classic
`extract → transform → load` pipeline, where each stage consumes the prior
stage's output, previously forced you to either flatten the whole pipeline
into one mega-activity or hand-thread outputs through shared state. Neither
is the graph you wanted to draw.

**Node input binding** (issue #702) closes that gap: bind a node's activity
input directly to one or more upstream node outputs, with one builder call
per data edge and zero hand-written output-threading.

```rust
#[activity(start_to_close = "30s")]
async fn extract_rows(_ctx: &ActivityContext) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    Ok(serde_json::json!([{ "id": 1 }, { "id": 2 }]))
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "30s")]
async fn transform_rows(_ctx: &ActivityContext, rows: Value) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    // `rows` IS the extract output, verbatim — no envelope to unpack.
    Ok(serde_json::json!({ "record_count": rows.as_array().map_or(0, Vec::len) }))
}

#[activity(start_to_close = "30s")]
async fn load_summary(_ctx: &ActivityContext, summary: Value) -> HarvestResult<Value> {
    // `summary` IS the transform output, verbatim.
    Ok(Value::Null)
}

#[dag]
pub fn etl_pipeline(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    let extract = dag.activity(extract_rows);
    let transform = dag.activity(transform_rows).input_from(&extract);
    let _load = dag.activity(load_summary).input_from(&transform);
}
```

### The three binding methods

| Method | The bound node's activity receives … |
|---|---|
| `.input_from(&up)` | `up`'s recorded output, **verbatim** — no `conf`/`dag_task` wrapper. |
| `.input_from_all(&[&a, &b])` | a JSON object merging both outputs, keyed by each upstream's **activity name**. |
| `.input_from_aliased(&[("k", &a)])` | a JSON object merging the outputs, keyed by the **given alias**. |

`.input_from_all` keys by activity name, so two upstreams sharing an activity
name is a `DagBuildError::DuplicateInputBindingKey` at build time — use
`.input_from_aliased` to disambiguate. A repeated alias is likewise a
`DuplicateInputBindingKey`, and declaring both an `.input_from(…)` binding
and a mapped upstream (`.map_activity(…).over(…)`) on the same node is a
`DagBuildError::ConflictingInputBinding`. All three are caught when the DAG
is compiled, never at run time.

```rust
// Fan-in: merge two upstream outputs into one keyed object.
let users = dag.activity(fetch_users);
let orders = dag.activity(fetch_orders);
let _report = dag
    .activity(join_report)
    .input_from_aliased(&[("users", &users), ("orders", &orders)]);
// join_report receives { "users": <fetch_users out>, "orders": <fetch_orders out> }
```

### Binding implies the dependency edge

A binding **is** a data edge, so it adds the upstream dependency
automatically — you do not also need `.upstream(&up)` (an extra one is
harmless). The bound node therefore runs *after* its bound upstream(s), and
only after their outputs are recorded.

### Skipped or failed upstreams yield null

If a bound upstream was skipped (by a trigger rule or a `.condition`) or
failed, its contribution to the binding is a deterministic `Value::Null` —
never a missing key. By default a node whose upstream was skipped is itself
skipped; to make a bound node run *anyway* and branch on the null, give it a
permissive trigger rule:

```rust
let maybe = dag.activity(maybe_step).upstream(&root).condition(|_| false); // skipped
let _final = dag
    .activity(finalize)
    .input_from(&maybe)               // maybe was skipped → input is null
    .trigger_rule(TriggerRule::AllDone);
```

### Determinism rule

A bound node's input is a **pure function of already-recorded upstream
outputs**. Those outputs are frozen in `harvest_events` before the bound
node is dispatched, so replay reconstructs byte-identical inputs on every
worker and every pass. Do not derive a node's input from process state, the
system clock, or random values — bind to an upstream output instead (and if
you need a captured wall-clock or random value, produce it with
[`ctx.side_effect`](/docs/harvest-reliability-knobs) in an upstream activity and read
it back through that activity's output). **No new `WorkflowEvent` variant
and no migration:** binding is computed in the workflow body from recorded
`ActivityCompleted` outputs, and an unbound DAG is byte-identical to today.

### Composition

Input binding composes with the rest of the DAG surface. It slots in
alongside a `.condition(…)` branch (evaluate the branch predicate over
upstream outputs, then bind the chosen node's input), and a bound node's
own output can feed a downstream [mapped fan-out](#dynamic-task-mapping-fan-out)
(`.map_activity(…).over(&bound_node)`) exactly as any other node's output
does. A worked end-to-end example — a three-stage ETL plus a fan-in merge —
lives in `autumn-harvest/examples/dag_data_flow.rs`.

A few interactions worth knowing:

* **A binding is also a `.condition(…)` edge.** Because a binding adds its
  upstream to the node's dependency list, that upstream *also* shows up in the
  node's `.condition(|ups| …)` slice — and `ups` is ordered by the sequence in
  which the builder calls run, not by which method added the edge. So a
  condition that indexes `ups[0]` must account for every `.input_from*` call:
  interleave `.input_from(…)` and `.upstream(…)` deliberately, since their call
  order determines the `ups[…]` indices your predicate sees (`.upstream(&a)`
  before `.input_from(&b)` → `ups[0]` is `a`; the reverse → `ups[0]` is `b`).
* **You can bind to a fan-out node's output.** `.input_from(&mapped_node)` — the
  reverse of "a bound node's output feeds a fan-out" above — is legal; the bound
  node receives the whole *collected array* the mapped node produced, as a single
  JSON array value.
* **An activity used in both bound and unbound positions gets different inputs.**
  The same `#[activity]` reused in a bound node (raw upstream output) and an
  unbound node (the trigger-input + `{ "conf": …, "dag_task": … }` wrapper)
  receives structurally different inputs in each position — write the activity's
  input deserialization to handle both shapes if you reuse it that way.
* **`input_from*` on a signal-gate node is a build error.** A binding on a gate
  is rejected at build time (`InputBindingOnGate`), mirroring the
  `input_from` + `map_activity` conflict. A gate dispatches no activity, so the
  binding *value* is ignored — but unlike the inert activity-only setters
  (`.queue()`, `.retry()`, `.start_to_close()`), a binding also auto-adds a
  dependency edge, which would silently make the gate wait for that upstream
  before its signal wait. Because that edge is a *structural* effect (not an
  inert dead field), the binding is rejected rather than swallowed. Use
  `.upstream(&gate_dependency)` to add a gate dependency deliberately.

## Automatic rollback — node compensation

A DAG that half-succeeds leaves its completed nodes' side effects **dangling**.
Reserve inventory, charge the card, allocate a shipment — then the label
printer 500s. The DAG fails, and the inventory is still held, the customer is
still charged, the shipment slot is still allocated.

Declare, per node, the activity that **undoes** it, and the engine rolls the
successful prefix back for you:

```rust
#[dag]
fn fulfillment(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    let reserve = dag
        .activity(reserve_inventory)
        .compensate(release_inventory);
    let charge = dag
        .activity(charge_payment)
        .upstream(&reserve)
        .compensate(refund_payment);
    let allocate = dag
        .activity(allocate_shipment)
        .upstream(&charge)
        .compensate(deallocate_shipment);
    let label = dag
        .activity(print_label)
        .upstream(&allocate)
        .compensate(void_label);
    // A sent notification cannot be un-sent — no compensator.
    let _notify = dag.activity(notify_customer).upstream(&label);
}
```

If `print_label` fails, the engine dispatches
`deallocate_shipment → refund_payment → release_inventory` — the succeeded
compensable prefix, in **reverse** order — and then returns the original
`Err("one or more DAG tasks failed")`. Compensation is cleanup, not an
outcome change.

Two builder methods, opt-in per node (at most one per node; last call wins):

| Method | Compensator name |
|--------|------------------|
| `.compensate(undo_fn)` | Derived from the fn item, like `dag.activity(…)` — typo-proof |
| `.compensate_named("undo")` | The given string (trimmed) — for a compensator whose fn item isn't in scope |

One compensator activity may be shared by several nodes; the envelope's
`dag_compensate` field says which node it is undoing.

`compensate_named` is name-based dispatch, **not** remote dispatch: the named
activity must still be registered with the builder, or plugin preflight fails
the boot (see [Errors you can hit at build time](#errors-you-can-hit-at-build-time)).

### What runs, and what doesn't

A node is compensated **iff** it BOTH succeeded AND declares a compensator:

| Node state | Compensated? |
|------------|--------------|
| Succeeded, compensator declared | **yes** |
| Succeeded, no compensator | no — nothing declared |
| Skipped by a trigger rule or a `.condition(…)` | no — it never ran |
| Never reached (an upstream failed or was skipped) | no |
| Failed, **even with a compensator declared** | no — only a *successful* step has an effect to undo |
| Succeeded **vacuously** — a mapped node over an *empty* upstream array | no — nothing was dispatched, so there is nothing to undo |

A DAG that **succeeds** builds no rollback machinery at all: zero compensator
dispatches, zero extra events.

A node rejected **before dispatch** — a mapped node fed a non-array upstream
output, or an input over the [payload cap](/docs/harvest-reliability-knobs) — counts as
`Failed`, so the rollback still runs for every node that *did* succeed. See
[the saga guide](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn-harvest/blob/trunk-dev/docs/saga.md#what-triggers-the-unwind-and-what-it-covers) for the
full rule, including the errors that deliberately bypass the rollback.

### What a compensator receives

One fixed envelope:

```json
{
  "dag_compensate": "charge_payment",
  "input":  { "conf": null, "dag_task": "charge_payment" },
  "output": { "charge_id": "ch_abc123", "amount_cents": 7700 }
}
```

* `dag_compensate` — the compensated node's activity name, so one generic
  compensator can serve several nodes.
* `input` — the node's resolved forward input, in one of four shapes:

  | Node kind | `input` |
  |-----------|---------|
  | Unbound | the `{ "conf": …, "dag_task": … }` wrapper |
  | [`.input_from(&up)`](#passing-data-between-nodes-node-input-binding) | the raw upstream output |
  | `.input_from_all(…)` / `.input_from_aliased(…)` | the **keyed object** the binding produced (`{"extract": …, "enrich": …}`) |
  | Mapped (`.map_activity(…).over(&up)`) | the **whole** mapped array |

* `output` — the node's recorded output.

The envelope embeds the node's whole input *and* output, so the issue #252
activity-input cap applies to the **envelope** — for a mapped node over a large
array it can be much larger than the node's own input was.

**Compensate by ID, read out of `output`.** Compensations re-run wholesale on
replay, so a compensator must be idempotent — `release_inventory(rsv-9001)` is
safe, `release_most_recent_reservation()` is not. See
[`docs/saga.md`](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn-harvest/blob/trunk-dev/docs/saga.md) for the full idempotency contract.

```rust
#[activity(start_to_close = "30s")]
async fn refund_payment(_ctx: &ActivityContext, envelope: Value) -> Result<Value, String> {
    let charge_id = envelope["output"]["charge_id"]
        .as_str()
        .ok_or("compensator envelope is missing output.charge_id")?;
    // Safe to call twice: refunding an already-refunded charge is a no-op.
    refund(charge_id).await
}
```

### Queue inheritance

A compensator dispatches on the **compensated node's** queue, so an undo lands
on the same worker pool that performed the forward step. A node with no
`.queue(…)` yields the empty-string queue, which resolves to the compensator
activity's own `#[activity(queue = …)]` default (falling back to `"default"`)
— exactly like an unqueued forward node. The node's `.retry(…)` /
`.start_to_close(…)` overrides are **not** inherited: those describe the
forward step's failure budget, so the compensator activity's own attributes
apply.

### Errors you can hit at build time

Each of these is rejected before a single node runs, rather than surfacing
mid-rollback when the state is already dangling:

| You wrote | You get |
|-----------|---------|
| `.compensate(…)` on a `signal_gate` | `CompensateOnGate` — "a gate dispatches no activity, so it has no side effect to undo" |
| `.compensate_named("")` | `EmptyCompensator` — "name the activity that undoes this node" |
| A compensator named after a forward node (or the declaring node, or a gate's signal) | `CompensatorNameCollidesWithNode` — a compensator under a node's name would corrupt the name-keyed history classification the DAG run graph and retry-from-node use |
| `.compensate(…)` on a **classic** (non-unified) DAG | `DagCompensationRequiresUnifiedExecution` — the classic executor has no rollback step, so the compensator would silently never run |
| A compensator that is a `local = true` activity | `LocalActivityInDag`, naming the compensator |

Plugin **preflight** additionally flags a compensator naming an *unregistered*
activity, so a missing compensator is caught before rollout.

### Cancellation

A **cancelled** run does not roll back: it returns the original DAG error and
dispatches zero compensators, consistent with Harvest's cancellation contract
("cancellation does not auto-compensate" — see [`docs/saga.md`](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn-harvest/blob/trunk-dev/docs/saga.md)).

### Known limitation — rollback is node-granular

Compensation operates on nodes, never on individual
[mapped](#dynamic-task-mapping-fan-out) cells. A `CollectAll` mapped node that
succeeded *with some failed cells* is compensated **once**, with the full cells
array (failed cells included) as `output` — the compensator decides per cell
what to undo. A `FailFast` mapped node driven to `Failed` by one cell is **not
compensated at all**, so its already-succeeded cells' side effects are left
uncompensated. If a mapped node's cells commit real side effects, prefer
`CollectAll` with a cell-aware compensator, or make each cell
self-compensating.

### Other limitations worth knowing

* **Compensators are not DAG nodes.** A compensation is recorded as an ordinary
  activity, so it appears in the event history but **not** in the DAG run-graph
  view or any definition-derived rendering. Read the history (or the
  `saga_compensated:{seq}` marker) to see whether a run unwound.
* **A compensated run is not retryable from a failed node.**
  `POST /dags/{name}/runs/{id}/retry` returns `409` — retry carries succeeded
  upstream nodes over, and the unwind just undid them. Start a fresh run.
* **An unsolicited signal silences the rollback counters.** A DAG consumes no
  signals of its own, so a stray signal leaves the unwind uncounted (it still
  runs, and still replays deterministically).
* **Rolling the engine back past this feature mid-unwind truncates it
  silently** — drain in-flight compensating runs first. See
  [`docs/saga.md`](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn-harvest/blob/trunk-dev/docs/saga.md).

A worked end-to-end example lives in
`autumn-harvest/examples/dag_compensation.rs`; the full contract (unwind order,
failure semantics, observability counters, rollback ordering) is in
[`docs/saga.md`](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn-harvest/blob/trunk-dev/docs/saga.md).

## Signal / approval gates

A **gate node** pauses a DAG run until a named signal arrives, then makes the
signal payload its output so downstream nodes can consume it. It's the
declarative way to insert a human approval — or any external-event wait —
*between* graph nodes without rewriting the whole pipeline as a `#[workflow]`.

Gate nodes are **unified-DAG only** (they lower onto the unified
workflow-execution path). A classic DAG containing a gate is rejected at build
time with a `DagSignalGateRequiresUnifiedExecution` error naming the DAG and
signal. Enable the `unified-dag-execution` feature (on by default).

### Declaring a gate

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use autumn_harvest::dag::GateTimeoutAction;

#[dag(default_queue = "approvals")]
fn order_approval_pipeline(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    let extract = dag.activity(extract_order);
    // Pause until the "approval" signal arrives; fail the run if it doesn't
    // arrive within 24h.
    let gate = dag
        .signal_gate_with_timeout(
            "approval",
            Duration::from_secs(24 * 60 * 60),
            GateTimeoutAction::FailRun,
        )
        .upstream(&extract);
    let _load = dag.activity(load_order).upstream(&gate);
}
```

`signal_gate(name)` is the no-timeout form (wait indefinitely).
`signal_gate_with_timeout(name, timeout, on_timeout)` arms a durable deadline.
A gate returns a `DagTaskRef`, so it composes exactly like any other node:
`.upstream(&gate)`, `.map_activity(f).over(&gate)` (fan out over an array
payload), `.condition(...)`.

### Delivering the signal (unblocking a gate)

Deliver the gate's signal with the ordinary standalone signal route — the gate
consumes it just like a `wait_for_signal`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/api/harvest/workflows/{exec_id}/signal/approval \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"approved": true, "reviewer": "alice"}'
```

The JSON body becomes the gate's output. A downstream node reads it via a
`.condition(...)` predicate or a `.map_activity(...).over(&gate)` fan-out.

### Timeout: fail vs continue

| `on_timeout`                  | when the deadline fires first | gate output   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| `GateTimeoutAction::FailRun`  | the DAG run **fails**         | —             |
| `GateTimeoutAction::Continue` | the run **continues**         | `Value::Null` |

### "Continue to a named branch" is declarative

There is no bespoke branch-target mechanism. Under `Continue`, the gate's
null-vs-payload output *is* the branch selector — attach a `.condition(...)` to
each downstream node:

```rust
#[dag(default_queue = "approvals")]
fn order_approval_with_fallback(dag: &mut DagBuilder) {
    let extract = dag.activity(extract_order);
    let gate = dag
        .signal_gate_with_timeout(
            "approval",
            Duration::from_secs(24 * 60 * 60),
            GateTimeoutAction::Continue,
        )
        .upstream(&extract);
    // Approved: gate output is the (non-null) signal payload.
    let _fulfil = dag
        .activity(load_order)
        .upstream(&gate)
        .condition(|ups| !ups[0].is_null());
    // Timed out: gate output is the null sentinel.
    let _escalate = dag
        .activity(escalate_to_manager)
        .upstream(&gate)
        .condition(|ups| ups[0].is_null());
}
```

The condition-skipped branch records a `dag_skip:{N}` marker exactly like any
other data-dependent skip, and the run still succeeds.

### Durability and replay

Gates reuse the existing signal/timer machinery — no new `WorkflowEvent`
variant, no migration. A gated run is durable across restarts and replays
deterministically: whichever of the signal or the deadline is recorded first
in history wins on every replay. See `examples/dag_approval_gate.rs` for a
complete, tested walkthrough (signal branch, timeout-fail, and
timeout-escalate, each with a `WorkflowReplayer` self-check).

### Edge traps

- **A JSON `null` payload looks like a timeout.** Under a `Continue` gate the
  timed-out output is `Value::Null`, so a downstream `.condition(|ups|
  ups[0].is_null())` cannot distinguish a timeout from an *approval whose signal
  body was literally `null`*. If your signal payload can legitimately be `null`,
  branch on a field instead (e.g. `.condition(|ups| ups[0].get("approved") ==
  Some(&serde_json::json!(true)))`), not on `.is_null()`.
- **A `Continue` gate cannot feed `.map` directly.** The null timeout output is
  not a JSON array, so `.map_activity(f).over(&gate)` fails at runtime with
  `mapped upstream output is not a JSON array`. Guard the map behind a
  `.condition(|ups| ups[0].is_array())` (or only map over gates whose signal
  payload is always an array — an unbounded `signal_gate` or a `FailRun` gate,
  which never emit the null sentinel).
- **Independent gates in one level are serialized, not concurrent.** Level
  isolation splits every gate into its own singleton execution level, so two
  gates that Kahn-levelling would place together run *sequentially* (the first
  gate resolves, then the second is reached) — they are **not** two overlapping
  wait windows. Gate nodes do not model concurrent signal waits.
- **Only `.upstream()` / `.condition()` / `.trigger_rule()` affect a gate.** A
  gate dispatches no activity, so the activity-only chained setters
  `.retry(...)`, `.start_to_close(...)`, `.queue(...)`, and
  `.map_failure_policy(...)` are accepted by the fluent builder but **silently
  ignored** on a gate node.

### MCP exposure

A `#[dag(mcp)]` DAG that contains a gate keeps its `signal_{dag}` MCP tool, so
an agent can unblock the gate by handle; an activity-only DAG suppresses that
tool.

## Registering DAGs with the plugin

```rust
HarvestPlugin::new()
    .workflows(workflows![checkout, issue_invoice])
    .activities(activities![
        export_billing_events,
        reconcile_gateway,
        notify_finance,
    ])
    .dags(dags![billing_reconciliation])
    .worker(WorkerConfig::default())
    .api("/api/harvest")
```

The activities used by the DAG must also be registered with `activities![]`
— a DAG references activities by name and dispatches them through the same
worker fleet as your workflow code.

## Triggering and managing DAG runs

The dashboard shows each DAG with its schedule, last run, next run, and a
graph view. The CLI and HTTP routes give you operator control:

```bash
harvest dag list
harvest dag trigger billing_reconciliation \
  --conf-json '{"date":"2026-05-07"}'
harvest dag pause billing_reconciliation
```

Or directly:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/harvest/dags/billing_reconciliation/trigger \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"conf":{"date":"2026-05-07"}}' | jq .
```

Pausing a DAG keeps the definition registered but stops the scheduler from
firing it; manual triggers still work. Resume by patching it back to active
through the same management route.

## Incremental scheduled jobs — last-completion-result carryover

Scheduled workflows can read the previous run's output without an external
high-water-mark table, using two `WorkflowContext` accessors added in issue #488:

| Accessor | Returns |
|---|---|
| `ctx.last_completion_result::<T>()` | Deserialized output of the most recent *COMPLETED* run of the same schedule; `None` on first run or if no prior run succeeded |
| `ctx.last_error()` | Error string from the most recent *terminal* run if it ended FAILED or TIMED_OUT; `None` when that run COMPLETED (recovery) or for manual starts |

Both values are **resolved once at workflow start** and **frozen into the
`WorkflowStarted` event**, so replay on any worker always returns the same
values without re-querying the database.

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use autumn_harvest::prelude::*;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Cursor {
    last_processed_id: i64,
}

#[workflow]
async fn incremental_etl(ctx: &WorkflowContext, _: ()) -> Result<Cursor, String> {
    // Read the cursor written by the previous successful run.
    let prior: Option<Cursor> = ctx
        .last_completion_result::<Cursor>()
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    // Log when recovering from a previous failure.
    if let Some(err) = ctx.last_error() {
        ctx.logger().warn(&format!("Previous run failed: {err}"));
    }

    let since_id = prior.as_ref().map(|c| c.last_processed_id).unwrap_or(0);
    // … fetch_batch and process rows WHERE id > since_id …
    Ok(Cursor { last_processed_id: since_id + 100 })
}
```

See `autumn-harvest/examples/incremental_etl_schedule.rs` for the full pattern.

### Semantic guarantees

- **First run**: both accessors return `None`.
- **Manual (non-scheduled) start**: both accessors return `None`; the
  `schedule_id` is `None` on the start params, so no carryover is resolved.
- **Skipped fires** (`OverlapPolicy::Skip`): a skipped slot never invokes
  `start_or_load_workflow_execution`, so the next run's `last_completion_result`
  still refers to the last non-skipped COMPLETED run. Skips do not reset or
  advance the cursor.
- **Recovery branch**: `last_completion_result` is the last *COMPLETED* output
  (may be several runs old); `last_error` reflects the single most recent
  *terminal* run and is `None` once that run COMPLETED — or was CANCELLED /
  TERMINATED (a later cancellation masks an older failure rather than
  resurrecting it). Check `last_error()` to know whether the job is still
  recovering.
- **continue-as-new**: a continuation inherits the predecessor's frozen
  carryover (the continuation is the same logical scheduled run), so cursors and
  recovery state survive the fork.
- **Slot ordering**: carryover selects the *previous logical fire* by the
  schedule slot (`scheduled_for`), not by completion time. Overlapping,
  catch-up, or backfilled fires that finish out of order therefore can't hand a
  later run an older slot's output and roll its cursor backward.
- **Non-overlapping assumption**: carryover is designed for the default
  `max_active_runs = 1` / `OverlapPolicy::Skip`. The source is the highest
  *earlier* slot that has reached a terminal state, so if you set
  `max_active_runs > 1` a later slot can start while an earlier slot is still
  running and observe a stale cursor (re-processing that slot's range). Keep
  cursor-style incremental jobs at `max_active_runs = 1`.
- **Backfills**: backfilled runs participate in the schedule's carryover lineage
  (they share the schedule's `schedule_id` and carry their own `scheduled_for`
  slot, so they slot into the lineage at the correct position).
- **Reset**: reset forks are operator interventions and are *excluded* from
  carryover (their `schedule_id` is left `None`) so resetting an old slot cannot
  roll a later run's incremental cursor backward.
- **PII / payload codecs**: the carried-over output copy frozen in
  `WorkflowStarted` is routed through the same payload codec and redacted-history
  allowlist as any other payload, so a configured codec encrypts/redacts it.

## Workflow schedule vs DAG — which one?

| Use a **workflow schedule** when… | Use a **DAG** when… |
|---|---|
| The work is one ordered sequence with a clear linear shape. | The work is a graph: fan-out, fan-in, parallel branches. |
| You need arbitrary signal handlers, durable timers, child workflows, or version gates inside the run. | The run is activity orchestration — including a **single signal/approval gate** between nodes, which a [signal gate](#signal--approval-gates) handles declaratively without dropping to a workflow. |
| Failure handling is per-step compensation (saga). | Failure handling is per-task trigger rules (AllDone, OneFailed). |
| You want to query state mid-run. | The graph is fixed and you want the dashboard's graph view. |

Both are scheduled the same way (cron expression on the registration), both
go through the same task queue, both record audit events. Pick the shape
that matches the work.

## Inspecting DAGs before they run

The engine ships three offline analysis tools that don't need a database
or running service. They're handy in CI or during DAG design.

- **Linter** (`autumn_harvest::dag_linter`) — flags missing retry policies,
  missing timeouts, and excessive parallelism in a `DagDefinition`. Good
  CI gate before merging a DAG change.
- **Simulator** (`autumn_harvest::dag_simulator`) — runs the DAG against
  per-activity mocks and returns each task's terminal status. Use it to
  verify trigger-rule wiring without a Postgres roundtrip.
- **Profiler** (`autumn_harvest::dag_profiler`) — given mock durations per
  activity, reports the critical path and wall-clock estimate.
- **Mermaid / DOT export** (`autumn_harvest::dag_export::export_mermaid`,
  `export_dot`) — render a DAG to a graph diagram for design review.

These are all built on the same `DagDefinition` your `#[dag]` function
produces, so they cost nothing extra to wire up — you already have the
definition in hand at test time.
