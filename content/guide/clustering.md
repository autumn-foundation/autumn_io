# Embedded Clustering

Two instances of the same Autumn binary can find each other, agree on who is
running, and share one distributed primitive — a cluster-wide counter — with
**no external coordination service**. No Redis, no Postgres, no etcd, no
ZooKeeper, and no new entry in your dependency tree: the substrate is compiled
into the framework and switched on by a config section.

The properties, stated plainly up front: this is an **opt-in** subsystem
(`[cluster] enabled = false` by default), it is **eventually consistent**
(nodes converge on a shared view; they never agree instantly), it is
**convergent (CRDT)** by construction rather than by timing, and its traffic is
**authenticated (HMAC-SHA256) but unencrypted**. This first slice is a
deliberate **2-node slice**: designed, tested, and documented for exactly two
nodes and exactly one shared primitive.

> **This is not database sharding.** [Horizontal Sharding](sharding.md) also
> uses the word "cluster" — a Redis-Cluster-style 16384-slot map routing
> tenants across `[[database.shards]]` Postgres databases. That is data
> placement across databases. This guide is about *application processes*
> finding each other over the network. The two features share no configuration
> keys, no code, and nothing but the unfortunate word.

## What you get

- **A member view.** Each node knows which nodes it currently believes are
  running, with their advertised address, status, and incarnation.
- **A cluster-wide counter.** `increment()` on one node is observable via
  `get()` on the other, typically within one push interval.
- **A health component.** `cluster:membership` reports the local view on
  `/actuator/health`, and the substrate's own metrics land on
  `/actuator/metrics`.

## What you do not get

- **Not mutual exclusion, not leader election.** For work that must run on one
  replica only, use [Distributed Locks](distributed-locks.md) or the
  [multi-replica scheduler](scheduled-multi-replica.md). The cluster counter
  cannot fence anything.
- **Not durable.** Counter values live in process memory for the lifetime of
  the process (see [Failure semantics](#failure-semantics)).
- **Not encrypted.** Authenticated (HMAC) only — deploy on a trusted network.
- **Not a replacement** for the Redis or Postgres backends behind sessions,
  jobs, channels, or the scheduler. It is an additional option that needs no
  datastore, not a substitute for one.
- **Not tested past two nodes.** The protocol pushes full state to every known
  peer on every interval; three or more nodes is out of scope for this slice.

## Enable it

```toml
# autumn.toml
[cluster]
enabled = true
secret = "…"                          # prefer the env var below
cluster_name = "autumn"
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:7946"
advertise_addr = "10.0.1.7:7946"
seed_peers = ["10.0.1.8:7946"]
node_id = "web-1"
push_interval_ms = 500
suspicion_timeout_ms = 2500
```

Every key has an environment override, which is how you supply the secret and
the per-instance addresses on a container platform:

```bash
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__ENABLED=true
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__SECRET=…                       # shared by every node
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__CLUSTER_NAME=autumn
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0:7946
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__ADVERTISE_ADDR=10.0.1.7:7946
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__SEED_PEERS=10.0.1.8:7946       # comma-separated
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__NODE_ID=web-1
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__PUSH_INTERVAL_MS=500
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__SUSPICION_TIMEOUT_MS=2500
```

### Configuration keys

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Master switch. When false nothing binds, no task spawns, no extension installs. |
| `secret` | secret string | none | Shared HMAC key, at least 16 bytes. A `SecretString`, never logged. |
| `cluster_name` | string | `"autumn"` | Logical cluster name. Covered by the MAC, so two clusters cannot mix. |
| `bind_addr` | socket addr | `"127.0.0.1:0"` | Where the cluster listener binds. Port `0` picks an ephemeral port. |
| `advertise_addr` | socket addr | none | The address peers should dial. Defaults to the bound address. |
| `seed_peers` | list of socket addrs | `[]` | Addresses to dial on startup. CSV in the env form. |
| `node_id` | string | none | Stable node identity. Defaults to a per-boot random id. |
| `push_interval_ms` | u64 | `500` | Base period of the state push, carrying ±20% per-node jitter. |
| `suspicion_timeout_ms` | u64 | `2500` | Silence after which a peer is locally down and leaves the view. |

### Validation

`[cluster]` is validated at boot and a bad section is a startup error, not a
warning:

- `enabled = true` requires `secret`, and the secret must be at least 16 bytes.
  There is no lenient unauthenticated mode.
- `suspicion_timeout_ms` must be at least `3 × push_interval_ms`. Below that
  ratio a single delayed push evicts a healthy peer and the view flaps.
- `push_interval_ms` must be at least `10`.
- `bind_addr`, `advertise_addr`, and every entry of `seed_peers` must parse as
  a `SocketAddr` (`host:port`, IP literal — hostnames are not resolved). Only
  `bind_addr` may carry port `0`: there it means "any free port" and the node
  advertises the port it was actually given, while an `advertise_addr` or a
  seed on port `0` is an address no peer can ever dial.
- `node_id` and `cluster_name`, when set, must be non-empty, at most 64
  bytes, and must not contain `#` (reserved as the separator in counter cell
  keys). Both travel in every frame and are covered by the MAC.
- An unknown key under `[cluster]` is a config error, like every other section.

### Choosing addresses

`bind_addr` is a local bind; `advertise_addr` is what other nodes dial. They
differ whenever the bind is a wildcard or the node sits behind NAT:

- Binding `0.0.0.0:7946` **requires** an explicit `advertise_addr` — `0.0.0.0`
  is not a dialable address, and a peer that learns it can never reach you.
- **Both** nodes must be dialable at the address they advertise. Replies never
  travel back over an accepted inbound socket: each node opens its own
  connection to the address it learned from the pushed state, so a node its
  peer cannot dial — behind NAT, or on a container network that only publishes
  one port — is a node its peer can accept frames *from* and never send frames
  *to*. That is a one-way cluster, and the asymmetry runs opposite to
  intuition: the **reachable** node converges on a two-member view, because it
  keeps accepting the unreachable node's pushes and learning its record, while
  the **unreachable** node receives nothing back and stays at a one-member view
  forever — even though it is the one that dialed first. `seed_peers` decides
  who makes first contact, not who has to be reachable.
- Leaving `bind_addr` at the default ephemeral port is therefore fine only when
  the peer can reach the resolved port — same host, same pod network — because
  that resolved port is what gets advertised. Give each node a fixed port and a
  dialable `advertise_addr` on anything more complicated.
- `seed_peers` is a dial list, not a membership list. It is used to make first
  contact; after that each node learns peers (and their advertised addresses)
  from the pushed state. Seeding one direction is enough — node B pointed at
  node A produces a two-member view on both.

## Using the counter

The cluster installs a `ClusterHandle` as an app extension when it is enabled,
so the lookup is an `Option` and your handler decides what a disabled cluster
means:

```rust
use autumn_web::cluster::ClusterHandle;
use autumn_web::extract::State;
use autumn_web::prelude::*;

#[post("/sightings")]
async fn record_sighting(State(state): State<AppState>) -> AutumnResult<Json<serde_json::Value>> {
    let cluster = state
        .extension::<ClusterHandle>()
        .ok_or_else(|| AutumnError::internal_server_error_msg("cluster is not enabled"))?;

    // Grow-only, cluster-wide. Applied locally right away, pushed to peers on
    // the next interval.
    let sightings = cluster.counter("boids_sighted");
    sightings.increment();

    Ok(Json(serde_json::json!({
        "node": cluster.node_id(),
        "members": cluster.members().len(),
        "boids_sighted": sightings.get(),
    })))
}

#[get("/sightings")]
async fn read_sightings(State(state): State<AppState>) -> AutumnResult<Json<serde_json::Value>> {
    let cluster = state
        .extension::<ClusterHandle>()
        .ok_or_else(|| AutumnError::internal_server_error_msg("cluster is not enabled"))?;

    // Read-only: no increment. This is the endpoint the two-terminal
    // walkthrough polls on node B after incrementing on node A.
    Ok(Json(serde_json::json!({
        "node": cluster.node_id(),
        "boids_sighted": cluster.counter("boids_sighted").get(),
    })))
}
```

| Method | Returns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ClusterHandle::node_id()` | `&str` | This node's id — configured, or the per-boot random one. |
| `ClusterHandle::local_addr()` | `SocketAddr` | The address actually bound (resolved port). |
| `ClusterHandle::members()` | `Vec<ClusterMemberInfo>` | The **local** view, including this node. |
| `ClusterHandle::counter(name)` | `ClusterCounter` | Cheap handle; call it per request. |
| `ClusterCounter::increment()` | `()` | Adds 1 to this node's own entry. Synchronous, never fails. |
| `ClusterCounter::get()` | `u64` | Saturating sum of every entry this node has merged. |

`ClusterMemberInfo` carries `{ id, addr, status, incarnation }`, where `status`
is `Alive` or `Suspect` — a member this node considers down is not in the view
at all.

`get()` may **jump upward** between two calls with no local increment in
between: that is a merge from a peer landing. It never moves downward. Treat it
as a lower bound on the true cluster-wide total, never as a limit to enforce.

## Verify with two terminals

One binary, two processes, one shared secret. Both terminals need the same
secret, so export it first in each:

```bash
export AUTUMN_CLUSTER__ENABLED=true
export AUTUMN_CLUSTER__SECRET="dev-only-cluster-secret-change-me"
```

Terminal A — the node that will be seeded against:

```bash
AUTUMN_SERVER__PORT=3000 \
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__NODE_ID=node-a \
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7946 \
cargo run
```

Terminal B — same binary, different ports, seeded at A:

```bash
AUTUMN_SERVER__PORT=3001 \
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__NODE_ID=node-b \
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7947 \
AUTUMN_CLUSTER__SEED_PEERS=127.0.0.1:7946 \
cargo run
```

Within a couple of push intervals both nodes report the same two members:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3000/actuator/health | jq '.components["cluster:membership"]'
curl -s localhost:3001/actuator/health | jq '.components["cluster:membership"]'
```

The `details` object renders only when health details are enabled
(`health.detailed = true`) — the dev profile's default, which is what `cargo
run` uses here. With details off you still get the component's `status`.

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "node_id": "node-a",
    "cluster": "autumn",
    "local_addr": "127.0.0.1:7946",
    "member_count": 2,
    "members": [
      { "id": "node-a", "addr": "127.0.0.1:7946", "status": "alive", "incarnation": 1765430001204 },
      { "id": "node-b", "addr": "127.0.0.1:7947", "status": "alive", "incarnation": 1765430017861 }
    ]
  }
}
```

Increment on A, read on B:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:3000/sightings     # {"boids_sighted":1,…} on node-a
curl -s localhost:3001/sightings             # 1 on node-b within a push interval
```

Now stop node B and watch node A converge to a one-member view. `Ctrl-C` takes
the clean path (B sends a leave, A drops it inside a few hundred milliseconds);
`kill -9` takes the failure path (A drops B after `suspicion_timeout_ms`).
Either way:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3000/actuator/health \
  | jq '.components["cluster:membership"] | {status, count: .details.member_count}'
# { "status": "UP", "count": 1 }
```

A one-member view is **healthy**. The indicator registers in the `HealthOnly`
group (see [Health Indicators](health-indicators.md)), so it never gates
`/ready` and never reports `DOWN` because a peer went away — an orchestrator
cannot be tricked into restarting the survivor.

`/actuator/metrics` exposes the same facts as counters, which is what you
alert on:

| Metric | Kind | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autumn_cluster_members` | gauge | Size of the local view. |
| `autumn_cluster_pushes_sent_total` | counter | State pushes written. |
| `autumn_cluster_pushes_unsendable_total` | counter | Outbound messages that could not be signed or framed, so the transport never saw them. Anything above zero is almost always a document past the 64 KiB frame cap — see [State growth](#failure-semantics). |
| `autumn_cluster_pushes_received_total` | counter | State pushes accepted from peers after verification. A `leave` is verified and applied without being counted here. |
| `autumn_cluster_merges_applied_total` | counter | Merges that changed local state. |
| `autumn_cluster_frames_rejected_total` | counter | Labelled `reason` — see the receive path below. Every label is published from boot, zeroes included, and `reason="oversize"` covers the connection-fatal step-1 rejections too. |
| `autumn_cluster_frames_dropped_total` | counter | Outbound frames swallowed by a full or closed peer queue. Anti-entropy re-sends the state, so drops are lossy only to latency — with one exception, the departure, which travels on a lane of its own and is warned about when it cannot be handed over ([Leave is advisory](#failure-semantics)). |

A steady `frames_rejected_total{reason="mac"}` means somebody is talking to
your port with the wrong secret. Any `pushes_unsendable_total` at all means
this node has stopped gossiping and its peer is about to evict it — the push is
also the heartbeat, so that failure is otherwise invisible from the inside.

## How it works

### The wire format

One TCP listener per node. Connections are byte pipes and nothing more:
**connection state carries zero liveness meaning**. A live connection with no
recent state push is a silent peer; a dropped connection that reconnects
before the suspicion timeout is a non-event.

Each frame is a 4-byte big-endian length prefix followed by exactly that many
bytes of JSON:

```
+-------------------+--------------------------------------+
| u32 big-endian N  | JSON envelope, exactly N bytes       |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------+
```

`N` is capped at **65536 (64 KiB)** and the cap is checked **before any
allocation**. A prefix of `0` or greater than the cap closes that connection
without reading further. The sender applies the same cap and refuses to emit an
oversized frame rather than sending something the peer must reject.

The envelope:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v` | u8 | Envelope version. `1` in this slice; any other value is dropped. |
| `key_id` | u8 | Which signing key made the MAC. Always `0`; reserved for key rotation. Anything else is dropped, and so is an envelope that omits the field. |
| `cluster` | string | Sender's `cluster_name`. A mismatch with the local name is dropped. |
| `sender` | string | Sender's node id — the *authenticated* identity. The source address is never an identity. |
| `incarnation` | u64 | Sender's incarnation when the frame was produced. |
| `seq` | u64 | Per-sender counter, incremented per frame, reset to `0` when the incarnation increases. |
| `payload` | string | The inner message as a JSON string. Opaque until the MAC verifies. |
| `mac` | string | Lowercase hex HMAC-SHA256, 64 characters. |

The MAC is computed over a **length-delimited** concatenation, so no field
value can be shifted into another field:

```
signing_input = L(v) ‖ L(cluster) ‖ L(sender) ‖ L(incarnation) ‖ L(seq) ‖ L(payload)

L(x) = 8-byte big-endian byte length of x, followed by x
  v            → 1 byte, the u8 value
  cluster      → UTF-8 bytes
  sender       → UTF-8 bytes
  incarnation  → 8 bytes, big-endian
  seq          → 8 bytes, big-endian
  payload      → UTF-8 bytes of the payload string
```

`key_id` is deliberately **outside** the signing input: it selects the key
rather than being protected by it. Flipping it selects a key that does not
exist, the MAC then fails, and the frame is dropped — a tampered `key_id` can
cost an attacker a dropped frame, never a forged one.

### Receive path

The order is normative. Every rejection logs and increments
`frames_rejected_total` with the named reason, and nothing ever panics. Steps
2-7 drop the offending frame and continue the read loop. Step 1 is the one
deliberate exception: a bad length prefix means the stream framing itself can
no longer be trusted — there is no way to know where the next frame starts —
so the connection closes and the peer re-dials with backoff. Closing a
connection is never an eviction; connection state carries zero liveness
meaning.

Step 4 is a second, quieter boundary: everything at or before it refuses
*unauthenticated* bytes, and each such refusal is charged to the connection the
frame arrived on — three of them and that connection is closed too (see
[Failure semantics](#failure-semantics)). Rejections past step 4 are never
charged, because the frame carried a valid MAC.

1. **Length prefix** — `N == 0` or `N > 65536` closes the connection with no
   allocation (`reason="oversize"`).
2. **Envelope parse** — malformed JSON, or an envelope missing a field, is
   dropped (`reason="malformed"`). Only the fixed envelope is parsed here.
3. **Header checks** — `v != 1` (`reason="version"`), `key_id != 0`
   (`reason="key_id"`), `cluster != cluster_name` (`reason="cluster"`).
4. **MAC** — recompute over the signing input and compare in **constant time**.
   A mismatch drops the frame (`reason="mac"`). Nothing below this line runs on
   unauthenticated bytes.
5. **Self-origin** — `sender == local node id` is dropped
   (`reason="self_origin"`). This is decided on the authenticated field, never
   on the peer address, so a seed list containing your own address and a
   reflected frame are both handled by the same rule.
6. **Replay watermark** — per sender, the node remembers the highest
   incarnation it has accepted and the highest `seq` accepted at that
   incarnation. A frame is dropped (`reason="replay"`) when its `incarnation`
   is lower than the recorded one, or equal to it with `seq` not greater than
   the recorded `seq`. A higher `incarnation` adopts the new incarnation and
   resets the sequence watermark.
7. **Payload parse** — only now is `payload` deserialized. An unknown message
   type or malformed body is dropped (`reason="payload"`).
8. **Merge** — the message is applied, and receipt is recorded against the
   sender for the liveness overlay.

### Messages

Two message types share the envelope. They are internally tagged so an unknown
future variant is a clean drop rather than a parse failure:

```json
{"type":"state_push","state":{
  "members": {
    "node-a": { "addr": "127.0.0.1:7946", "incarnation": 1765430001204, "status": "alive" },
    "node-b": { "addr": "127.0.0.1:7947", "incarnation": 1765430017861, "status": "alive" }
  },
  "counters": {
    "boids_sighted": { "node-a#1765430001204": 3, "node-b#1765430017861": 2 }
  }
}}
```

```json
{"type":"leave"}
```

`state_push` carries the entire replicated document and doubles as the
heartbeat — there is no separate ping. `leave` carries no fields at all: it
applies to the `(sender, incarnation)` pair in the authenticated envelope, so a
captured leave can never be replayed against a newer incarnation of that node.

Wire structs tolerate unknown fields, and the structs *inside* the payload
default missing ones, so a newer node can add fields without breaking an older
peer. (This is the opposite of the config layer, where an unknown key is an
error.) The envelope itself is the exception: every one of its fields is
required, and one that is absent is a step-2 `malformed` drop — an envelope is
what authenticates a frame, so there is nothing in it to be lenient about.

### Membership

Membership is two things that are easy to confuse, so they are separated in the
types:

**Replicated status** is part of the shared document and converges. A
`MemberRecord` is `{ addr, incarnation, status }` where `status` is only
`Alive` or `Left`. Records merge pairwise:

1. Higher `incarnation` wins.
2. At equal incarnation, `Left` beats `Alive` — a leave is never undone by an
   in-flight older push at the same incarnation.
3. At equal incarnation and equal status, the lexicographically greater `addr`
   wins. This tie-break exists only to keep the merge commutative; it should
   never fire in practice.

**Incarnation** is seeded at boot from the wall clock (Unix **milliseconds**,
read through the injected clock), so a restart — clean or crash — comes back
at a strictly higher incarnation with no persistence anywhere. Millisecond
granularity is load-bearing: no real process restarts within the same
millisecond, so in practice two boots do not mint equal incarnations — which is
what keeps refutation's exact-echo check sound (a record byte-equal to this
boot's own record really is an echo of this boot, rather than a leftover from
the previous one). That is what lets a node with a stable `node_id` rejoin
after a crash: its peer's replay watermark is keyed by `(sender, incarnation)`,
and a fresh, higher incarnation starts a fresh sequence rather than colliding
with the dead boot's watermark.

That argument is a probability, not a guarantee. A clock that is frozen,
pre-epoch (the reading clamps to `0`), or stepped backwards onto the exact
millisecond a previous boot read *will* mint an equal incarnation, and the two
boots then share a counter cell and a replay watermark until an operator
restarts one of them. Run the cluster on hosts with a working clock; the
millisecond seeding makes the collision a coincidence, not a routine
same-second restart.

**Refutation** keeps a live node from being buried, and covers the residual
restart cases (a restart within the same clock *millisecond*, or a clock that
stepped backwards). A node that receives any record about *itself* at an
incarnation greater than or equal to its own — whatever the status, `Left` or a
stale `Alive` — sets its incarnation to one above the highest it has seen for
itself, marks itself `Alive`, and pushes immediately. Because rule 1 outranks
rule 2, that refutation wins everywhere. The trigger works even when the
returning node is being replay-dropped by its peer, because the peer's own
pushes still reach it: the returning node's watermark table is fresh, so it
accepts the peer's state, sees its own stale record, and bumps past it —
provided the peer still holds a record about it at all. Once that record has
been pruned there is nothing left to refute, which is why pruning a member
forgets it *whole*: the peer drops the pruned node's replay watermark along
with its tombstone, so the returning node's next frame is judged as a fresh
sender at whatever incarnation it carries. Its *record* still waits out the
peer's recently-pruned note when it returns at an incarnation that peer already
collected — which only a backward clock step produces — so that rejoin is
adopted when the note lapses instead of on the first frame. A boot with a
working clock carries a higher incarnation and is adopted at once.

**Local liveness** is *not* replicated. Each node times the silence since it
last accepted a frame from each peer, using the injected monotonic clock:

```
   accepted a frame                accepted a frame
        │                                │
        ▼                                ▼
   ┌─────────┐  silence > 2×push   ┌─────────┐  silence > suspicion  ┌──────┐
   │  Alive  │────────────────────▶│ Suspect │──────────────────────▶│ Down │
   └─────────┘                     └─────────┘                       └──────┘
     in view                        in view                        not in view
```

`Suspect` at twice the push interval is a warning, not an eviction: with ±20%
jitter a healthy peer's gap never approaches it, but two missed pushes are
worth showing an operator. `Down` at `suspicion_timeout_ms` removes the member
from the view. Because validation forces `suspicion_timeout_ms ≥ 3 ×
push_interval_ms`, `Suspect` always strictly precedes `Down`.

The view is therefore **local**: replicated `Alive` records, minus peers this
node currently considers down, plus this node itself. Two nodes can briefly
disagree about the view — that is exactly what eventually consistent means
here, and it is why the counter's correctness does not depend on the view.

**Leaving** has a fast path and a correctness path, and only the second one is
a contract. On shutdown a node marks its own record `Left` at its current
incarnation and sends its **final document** — one last `state_push`, carrying
both the departure and every counter cell written since the previous push —
followed by the `leave`, together bounded to **250 ms** so they always fit
inside the shutdown drain budget. The final push is what keeps an increment
that arrived after the last push round from dying with the process; the `leave`
that follows costs one frame and covers the peer that holds no record for this
node at all. Both frames take a per-peer *departure lane* that the writer reads
ahead of anything already queued, so a peer stalled long enough to fill its send
queue cannot swallow them (see [Failure semantics](#failure-semantics)). That is
the fast path, and it is best-effort.

The departure runs **after** in-flight HTTP requests have drained, not when the
listener closes: a request served during shutdown can still increment a
counter, and it must find a push loop still running. If the process is killed, the network eats the
frame, or the peer is mid-reconnect, the peer still converges — by silence, at
the suspicion timeout. Never build anything on a leave arriving.

Records for departed members stay in the document as tombstones so `Left`
propagates, and are pruned locally after ten suspicion timeouts — measured from
when *this* node first observed the departure, so a tombstone re-taught by a
lagging peer after it was pruned ages from that re-observation and expires
again rather than living forever.

A tombstoned member also stays in the push target set until its tombstone is
pruned. That is deliberate and costs a few frames aimed at a dead address: it
is the only channel by which a node that restarted with a *lower* incarnation
(a clock that stepped backwards) can hear its own `Left` record, refute it, and
rejoin — its pushes are being replay-dropped by the peer that holds the
tombstone, so it has to be told.

Pruning that tombstone therefore drops the departed node's replay watermark
with it. Once the record is gone there is no `Left` to hear and no address to
push to, so a watermark that outlived it would replay-drop the returning node's
every frame with no way left to argue — a permanent partition between two nodes
that both look healthy. A member is forgotten whole or not at all.

An `Alive` record needs an exit of its own, because only `Left` records are ever
pruned. A record nothing refreshes — a peer that vanished without a leave, a
member learned from a peer's document and never heard from, a record re-admitted
by a replayed frame — would otherwise stay in the document for the life of the
process. So a member this node has not heard from for a full tombstone window
(the same ten suspicion timeouts) is recorded as `Left` at that member's current
incarnation, and the ordinary tombstone lifecycle takes it from there. That is a
local decision written into the replicated document, and it says exactly what
the suspicion timeout already says — *this node considers that member gone* —
one whole tombstone window after the view said it. A live member recorded that
way (a partition that outlasted the window) has the standing answer: tombstones
stay push targets, so it hears the `Left` record about itself and refutes at a
higher incarnation, which wins everywhere by rule 1.

### The counter

`ClusterCounter` is a grow-only CRDT counter, the simplest structure that makes
"observable on the other node" a property of the data rather than of the
network's timing:

- Each counter name maps to a map of `cell → u64`, where a cell is keyed by
  `node id # incarnation` — one cell per node *per boot*. A node writes **only
  its own current cell**, so no two writers ever share a cell, and a restarted
  node never resumes a cell an older boot of itself already populated. Without
  the incarnation in the key, a node restarting with a stable `node_id` would
  start its cell at zero while its peer remembers the old, higher value; the
  max-merge would then silently absorb every new increment until the new count
  overtook the old one. Keying cells by boot removes that failure by
  construction — no recovery step, no readiness gate.
- `increment()` adds 1 to this node's current cell, immediately and locally,
  then nudges the push task. Local `get()` reflects it at once. The nudge is
  rate-limited to one prompt push per quarter of `push_interval_ms` (never
  under 50 ms, never longer than the interval itself): the first write after a
  quiet gap still propagates promptly, and a handler incrementing on every
  request propagates at that floor instead of signing and sending the whole
  document once per request.
- Merge is **per-entry maximum**. That is commutative, associative, and
  idempotent, so pushes may arrive out of order, be duplicated, or be dropped
  entirely, and the result is the same once any later push lands.
- `get()` is the **saturating sum** of every entry.

There is no `decrement`. A grow-only counter is what makes the merge total and
the arithmetic auditable; a decrement map is a possible later addition and the
wire format leaves room for it.

**Saturation, not wrapping.** A per-node entry saturates at `u64::MAX` instead
of wrapping, and `get()` saturates the sum. An implausible count clamps; it
never wraps to zero and never panics.

## Failure semantics

**Partition.** Both sides keep accepting increments and keep serving their own
view; neither side is fenced and no write is rejected. During the split each
side reports a total missing the other side's contributions. When the partition
heals, the next push in each direction merges both documents and both nodes
converge on the full sum. Nothing is lost, because the counter only grows.

**Replay.** A captured frame replayed later is dropped by the per-sender
sequence watermark, and a replayed `leave` can only ever name the incarnation
it was signed at. If it names a stale incarnation, it loses the merge; if it
somehow lands, the live node refutes at a higher incarnation and re-appears.
Frames are authenticated but not timestamped, so replay protection is
per-sender-sequence, not clock-based.

The one replay a watermark cannot catch is a frame captured before a member
departed and replayed after that member's record was pruned: pruning forgets the
sender whole, watermark included, so the frame verifies again as a fresh sender.
Two bounds answer it, and neither needs the secret to have stayed secret. While
this node still remembers collecting that id — twice the tombstone window — the
record is refused whatever its status, `Left` or `Alive`. Once that memory
lapses and the record is re-learned, it is a member nothing refreshes, so a full
tombstone window of silence records it as `Left` and it prunes like any other
tombstone. Replaying one captured frame per departed id therefore costs bounded
churn over one window, never a document that ratchets upward toward the frame
cap.

**Authenticated (HMAC), unencrypted.** Every frame is authenticated with
HMAC-SHA256 over the shared secret, and unauthenticated bytes never reach a
payload parse. Frames are **not encrypted**: anyone who can read the wire can
read your node ids, advertised addresses, counter names, and counts, and anyone
who can reach the port can make you compute one HMAC per frame. Run the cluster
port on a trusted network — a private VPC subnet, a WireGuard or Tailscale
interface, a container network — and never expose it to the internet. Do not
put anything sensitive in a counter name. Key rotation is not in this slice:
`key_id` is reserved for it, and changing the secret today means restarting
both nodes.

**What an unauthenticated connection can cost you.** Reaching the port is
enough to open a socket, so the listener bounds what a socket is worth before
anyone proves they know the secret. Three bounds, and the third is what makes
the first one hold:

- At most **128** inbound connections are held open at once; past that a new
  one is accepted and closed immediately.
- A connection that has not delivered a complete frame within four suspicion
  timeouts (at least 10 seconds) is closed.
- A connection whose frames keep being refused **before** they authenticate is
  closed on the **third** such frame. The receive path's MAC check (step 4) is
  the line: `oversize`, `malformed`, `version`, `key_id` and `mac` are refusals
  of bytes anyone who can reach the port could have sent, and each one is
  charged to the connection it arrived on. Verdicts past the MAC —
  `self_origin`, `replay`, `payload` — are never charged, because the frame
  came from a holder of the secret. The count does not decay.

The idle deadline alone bounds a *silent* socket, not a talkative one: without
the third bound a stranger holds a slot for as long as it likes by sending one
well-framed garbage frame per idle window, and holds all 128 the same way — at
which point your actual peer is the one being refused at the cap. Three frames
rather than one is deliberate: a peer that is misconfigured, or caught halfway
through a secret rotation, gets far enough onto the wire to be diagnosed from
`frames_rejected_total{reason="mac"}` and the rejection log line before its
socket is taken away.

None of these can fire on a healthy peer — one peer needs one connection, a
peer silent past its suspicion timeout is already out of the view, and a peer
whose frames verify is never charged for one. Note what the third bound does
*not* cover: frames are authenticated but not encrypted, so somebody who can
capture a peer's frame off the wire can replay it to hold a connection open
(`reason="replay"`) indefinitely. That is inside the trust boundary this design
already assumes, and it is the same reason none of this is a substitute for
keeping the port off the public internet.

**Leave is advisory, suspicion is the contract.** The 250 ms departure (final
`state_push` plus `leave`) is a latency optimization for clean shutdowns.
Correctness comes from the suspicion timeout, which handles the kill, the
crash, the pulled cable, and the lost leave identically. A shutdown that
overruns its drain budget is a kill as far as the peer is concerned.

Both departure frames travel on a small per-peer lane of their own, which the
peer's writer reads before anything queued: **a farewell supersedes the state
pushes already queued** for that peer, so a peer stalled long enough to fill its
64-deep send queue cannot swallow this node's last words along with them. That
is safe because every push carries the whole document — the queued frames are
older copies of the one the farewell carries, at lower sequence numbers, and the
peer's replay watermark discards whichever of them still arrive. When even that
lane cannot take the frame, the departure is **counted in
`autumn_cluster_frames_dropped_total` and warned about** on the way out rather
than being lost quietly: **a dead writer still means the suspicion path**.

**Known residuals (slice 2).** Four bounded consequences of the above, none of
them correctness:

- Pushes still queued behind a farewell are written after it and rejected by the
  survivor's replay watermark, so `frames_rejected_total{reason="replay"}` can
  move by up to one queue's worth at a clean departure of a stalled peer.
- The departure flush waits for *every* queued frame, not just the farewell, so
  a departing node whose queue had backed up normally spends its whole 250 ms
  budget and logs the "not fully flushed" line even though its farewell left
  first.
- The lane guarantees the farewell reaches the writer; it does not guarantee the
  writer gets to write it. A writer parked in a dial or a write when shutdown
  begins is cancelled at the end of the same 250 ms grace, and the peer converges
  on the suspicion timeout.
- A stable-id node that restarts with a *backward* clock **and** a different
  advertised address rejoins only after the tombstone and recently-pruned
  windows expire: the incumbent's refutation pushes go to the departed boot's
  old address, and the returning node's own pushes are dropped as replays
  before the payload carrying its new address is read. The delay is bounded —
  the windows expire and the node is then admitted as a fresh sender — and the
  clean answer, an authenticated recovery exchange addressed to the frame's
  source, is the next slice's work.

**Counter volatility.** Counters live in process memory for the lifetime of the
process. There is no persistence. A restarted node starts a fresh cell (its
cells are keyed by boot incarnation) and re-learns every older cell — including
its own previous boots' — from its peer, so a rolling restart of one node at a
time preserves the total and new increments count from the first request; but
if every node is down at once, the count is gone. If you need a durable count,
write it to the database (see [Counter Caches](counter-cache.md)) and use this
for ephemeral, cluster-wide tallies.

**State growth.** The document holds one member record per distinct node id
ever seen, one counter cell per `(node id, boot incarnation)` that has
incremented each counter name, and each node keeps one replay-watermark row
per distinct sender it has accepted a frame from. Member records are pruned
after their tombstone window, and the pruned member's watermark row goes with
it — a member is forgotten whole, which is what lets it come back (see
Refutation above). A node does keep one small local note per pruned member —
the `(node id, incarnation)` it collected — for twice the tombstone window, and
refuses to re-adopt any record for that member at that incarnation or lower
while the note lasts; without it two peers pruning at different times re-teach each other the
same `Left` record indefinitely and departed ids never actually leave. The note
is local garbage collection, never gossiped, and never applied to a higher
incarnation, so a rejoining node is unaffected. An `Alive` record has an exit
too, and it is what bounds the member table: a member this node has not heard
from for a full tombstone window is recorded `Left` at its current incarnation
and then prunes on the ordinary schedule (see Membership above). That covers
every record no leave will ever arrive for — a peer that vanished, a member
learned from a document and never heard from, or one re-admitted by replaying a
captured pre-departure frame after its watermark was forgotten — so each such
record costs one window of churn rather than a permanent row. Every member
record either keeps being refreshed or leaves. **Counter cells are not
pruned**: dropping one would make
`get()` move downward. The consequence is operational: every boot that
increments a counter leaves one `u64` cell behind, and a node with no
configured `node_id` additionally mints a fresh member id per restart. Set an
explicit, stable `node_id` on any long-lived deployment, and keep counter names
a small fixed set from your code rather than anything derived from user input.
Cell garbage collection is out of scope for this slice.

A document that outgrows the 64 KiB frame cap stops being sendable at all —
and since the state push *is* the heartbeat, the node then keeps merging its
peer's pushes and looks healthy to itself while the peer sees silence and
evicts it at the suspicion timeout. That is what
`autumn_cluster_pushes_unsendable_total` is for: it counts every message the
node could not frame, and a warning naming the serialized size against the cap
is logged (at most once a minute) the moment it starts.

**A one-member view is healthy.** `cluster:membership` reports `UP` with one
member, exactly as with two. It is a `HealthOnly` indicator: it never gates
`/ready`, and it never reports `DOWN` because a peer disappeared. A surviving
node keeps serving its counter and its traffic, and a liveness probe must never
be able to kill it for being alone.

**Two nodes.** Every push carries the full document to every known peer, there
are no indirect probes, and there is no quorum anywhere. That is a sound design
at two nodes and an unproven one beyond that. Treat larger fleets as future
work, not as a supported configuration.
