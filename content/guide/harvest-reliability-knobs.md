# Reliability knobs you'll reach for



These come up in roughly the order you'll need them.

**Retries that aren't exponential.** Use `RetryPolicy::fixed(attempts, delay)`
for a flat retry, or build a `RetryPolicy` directly when you need a custom
shape (max interval, backoff coefficient, non-retryable error filters).

**A fleet-wide reliability floor (builder-default retry / `start_to_close`).**
Instead of repeating the same `retry = …` / `start_to_close = …` on every
`#[activity]`, set a default *floor* once on the worker and let activities that
care override it:

```rust
WorkerConfig::default()
    .with_default_activity_retry_policy(RetryPolicy::fixed(3, Duration::from_secs(1)))
    .with_default_activity_start_to_close(Duration::from_secs(30))
```

The floor is resolved at **schedule time** as the lowest-priority fallback. The
full precedence, highest first:

1. **call-site override** — `ctx.execute_activity_with_opts(..)` / the DAG opts path
2. **activity's own default** — `#[activity(retry = …, start_to_close = …)]`
3. **builder default** — the two `with_default_activity_*` methods above
4. **implicit fallback** — today's behaviour when nothing is set anywhere

It is **opt-in**: leave both unset and every activity behaves byte-for-byte as
it does today. In particular the implicit fallback is *not* "a single attempt" —
a regular activity with no retry configured anywhere is still enqueued with the
engine's default `max_attempts = 3` (a local activity's implicit fallback is a
single attempt). The floor only raises the bar for activities that declared
*nothing*; an activity that declares its own `retry` (or a call site that passes
one) always wins.

Scope: this covers **retry** and **`start_to_close`** only —
`heartbeat_timeout` and `schedule_to_start` are deliberately out of scope (they
have no fleet-wide "floor" semantics). For **local** activities the resolved
`start_to_close` is still clamped by
`WorkerConfig::max_local_activity_start_to_close` (60 s by default), so a
builder default larger than that cap never grants a local activity more than the
cap.

**Per-activity concurrency caps.** Add `max_concurrent = N` to bound the
cluster-wide in-flight count without provisioning a dedicated worker. Share
the budget across activities by giving them the same `concurrency_key`.
Inspect live counts with `harvest concurrency status`.

**Local activities.** Mark trivial in-process work with
`#[activity(local = true)]` to skip the task-queue round-trip. Local
activities still record `LocalActivityScheduled` / `LocalActivityCompleted`
events, so replay works identically — they just run inline on the workflow
worker. Use them for fast deterministic glue (formatting, hashing, cache
lookups under a few hundred ms). Don't use them for I/O that might exceed
the 60 s default cap.

**Dedicated task queues.** Add `queue = "email-workers"` to an activity and
spin up a worker that subscribes to it:

```rust
WorkerConfig::default().with_queues(["default", "email-workers"])
```

Useful when one activity class (e.g. PDF rendering) needs its own resource
budget or its own scaling group.

**Cross-retry wall-clock deadline (`schedule_to_close`).** All three
per-attempt timeouts (`start_to_close`, `schedule_to_start`, `heartbeat_timeout`)
bound a single attempt. Use `schedule_to_close` when you need a hard ceiling
on the *total* time an activity may consume across every attempt and all
back-off sleeps combined:

```rust
#[activity(
    schedule_to_close = "5m",   // total budget: 5 minutes from first enqueue
    start_to_close   = "30s",   // each attempt: 30 s
    retry = RetryPolicy::exponential(10, Duration::from_secs(1)),
)]
async fn call_payment_api(ctx: &ActivityContext, req: PaymentRequest)
    -> Result<PaymentId, String> { … }
```

If the deadline elapses while the task is queued (PENDING) or running (RUNNING),
the timeout scanner appends `ActivityTimedOut { ScheduleToClose }` to history
and fails the task. If the deadline would be exceeded by the next retry's
back-off delay, the retry is skipped and the same event is appended instead of
requeuing — so the workflow sees a clean `HarvestError::Timeout { ScheduleToClose }`
rather than an exhausted-retry failure.

**Honor a downstream's own `Retry-After` (`ActivityFailure::with_retry_after`).**
`RetryPolicy` computes a generic backoff shape, but a well-behaved downstream
(an HTTP API, a queue broker) often tells you *exactly* how long to wait —
`Retry-After: 30` on a `429`/`503`. Let the activity hand that hint straight to
the engine instead of guessing a schedule that either retries too eagerly or
waits too long:

```rust
#[activity(retry = RetryPolicy::exponential(5, Duration::from_secs(1)))]
async fn call_rate_limited_api(ctx: &ActivityContext, req: ApiRequest)
    -> Result<ApiResponse, String>
{
    let client = ctx
        .state::<HttpClient>()
        .ok_or_else(|| "HttpClient state must be registered".to_string())?;
    let resp = client.post(&req).await.map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
    if resp.status() == 429 || resp.status() == 503 {
        let retry_after = resp
            .headers()
            .get("Retry-After")
            .and_then(|h| h.to_str().ok())
            .and_then(|s| s.parse::<u64>().ok())
            .map(Duration::from_secs)
            .unwrap_or_default();
        return Err(ActivityFailure::retryable("RateLimited", "downstream asked us to back off")
            .with_retry_after(retry_after)
            .into_error_payload());
    }
    resp.json().await.map_err(|e| e.to_string())
}
```

`with_retry_after(Duration)` overrides the policy-computed delay **for that one
attempt only**, scheduling the next attempt at `now + hint` instead of the
policy's own backoff. It does **not** change how many attempts are allowed —
`max_attempts` and the attempt counter are unaffected, so a downstream that
keeps returning `Retry-After` still exhausts to a terminal failure/DLQ entry on
schedule. The hint is clamped to `[0, ceiling]` (default 15 minutes, tune with
`WorkerConfig::with_retry_after_ceiling(Duration)` /
`HarvestBuilder::worker(..)`): a hint above the ceiling clamps down rather than
being rejected, and a zero/absent hint falls straight through to the policy's
own delay — so leaving `retry_after` unset is byte-for-byte today's behaviour.
A **non-retryable** failure (`ActivityFailure::non_retryable(..)`, or a policy
`non_retryable_errors` match) always wins over any `retry_after` hint and
routes to the terminal/DLQ path immediately, regardless of the delay hint.
`retry_after` also composes with `schedule_to_close` above: if `now + hint`
would cross the cross-retry deadline, the deadline-exceeded path fires
(`ActivityTimedOut { ScheduleToClose }`) instead of requeuing at the hinted
time. There is no new event variant and no replay impact — the hint only
influences the transient `harvest_task_queue.scheduled_at` column, never
`harvest_events`.

**Interaction with a per-activity circuit breaker.** If the same activity also
carries a `#[activity(circuit_breaker = ...)]` policy (issue #369), be aware
that the breaker's rolling failure window only counts a failure toward
tripping the circuit when it lands within `window` of the *prior* failure. A
`retry_after` hint that regularly spaces consecutive attempts *wider* than the
breaker's configured `window` can defeat trip detection entirely — the
downstream may be persistently unhealthy, yet the breaker never opens because
consecutive failures never land inside one rolling window. If you pair
`retry_after` with a circuit breaker on the same activity, configure the
breaker's `window` generously — wider than the largest `retry_after` hint (or
the ceiling) you expect that downstream to ever send. See
[the circuit-breaker runbook](https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn-harvest/blob/trunk-dev/docs/runbooks/activity-circuit-breaker.md) for the
breaker's own configuration guidance.

**Decision matrix — which timeout to use:**

| Scenario | Use |
|---|---|
| Bound a single attempt | `start_to_close` |
| Bound queue wait before first attempt | `schedule_to_start` |
| Detect a stuck activity (liveness) | `heartbeat_timeout` |
| Bound all attempts + back-off combined | `schedule_to_close` |
| Bound the whole workflow end-to-end | `#[workflow(execution_timeout = "…")]` |

`schedule_to_close` does **not** support local activities (rejected at compile
time with a clear error). Local activities are fast in-process work; use
`start_to_close` + a low retry count instead.

**Soft SLA — page before the customer notices (`#[workflow(sla = "…")]`).**
Every knob above is a *hard* deadline: when it fires it terminates, fails, or
skips the work. But the most common production question is softer — *"this run
is healthy and still making progress, but it's far slower than it should be —
alert me **before** it's a problem."* That's the soft SLA:

```rust
#[workflow(sla = "2h", execution_timeout = "6h")]
async fn nightly_reconciliation(ctx: &WorkflowContext, input: Input)
    -> Result<(), String> { /* … */ }
```

When the run passes its `sla` deadline, Harvest emits the
`harvest.workflow.sla_breached{workflow, queue}` counter **exactly once** and
sets the server-side `sla_breached` / `sla_breached_at` fields — and **does
nothing else**. The run keeps executing; if it later succeeds it reaches
`COMPLETED` normally. The signal carries **zero `harvest_events` footprint** (no
new event variant, replay-neutral, like query handlers). Override per-run at
start with `sla_secs` in the HTTP start body; omit the attribute and a run has
no SLA. Find breached-but-still-running work with
`GET /workflows?sla_breached=true`.

**SLA vs `execution_timeout` — they answer different questions:**

| Goal | Use | On deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Alert on a slow-but-healthy run | `sla` | metric + flag, run continues |
| Kill a runaway / hung run | `execution_timeout` | run is **terminated** (`TIMED_OUT`) |

Pair them: `sla` < `execution_timeout` gives you a page first, then a hard cap.
If you set `sla` **larger** than `execution_timeout`, the hard timeout would
fire first and the soft signal could never fire — so Harvest **clamps `sla`
down to `execution_timeout`** at start time. Pause suspends the SLA clock
(resume pushes `sla_deadline_at` forward by the paused span), so a deliberately
parked run never false-breaches.

**Checkpoint before the deadline kills you (deadline-aware `continue_as_new`).**
A long-lived entity workflow (a subscription, a cart, a device) can run for
weeks while recording only a handful of events — it never approaches the history
event-count threshold that `ctx.should_continue_as_new()` watches. But if it
declares an `execution_timeout` for runaway protection, that hard timeout will
eventually terminate it mid-flight even though it is perfectly healthy. To avoid
that, `should_continue_as_new()` has a **second trigger** (issue #772): it also
returns `true` once the run has consumed a configurable fraction (default
`0.8`) of its `execution_timeout` budget. Checkpoint with `continue_as_new`
*before* the hard deadline truncates you, carrying state forward into a fresh
run with a fresh deadline:

```rust
#[workflow(execution_timeout = "24h")]
async fn subscription_entity(ctx: &WorkflowContext, state: SubState) -> Result<SubState, String> {
    // Fires on history size OR ~80% of the execution_timeout budget.
    if ctx.should_continue_as_new() {
        ctx.continue_as_new(serde_json::to_value(&state).unwrap()).await?;
    }
    // ... one cycle of durable work ...
    Ok(state)
}
```

Two replay-safe, event-free accessors back this: `ctx.deadline()` (the
**nominal** `WorkflowStarted` timestamp + effective `execution_timeout`, or
`None` when there is no timeout) and `ctx.time_until_deadline()` (remaining time
to the nominal deadline, measured against the replay-safe recorded clock
`ctx.system_now()`, **never** `chrono::Utc::now()`). A workflow with **no**
`execution_timeout` behaves exactly as before and records nothing extra. Tune
the fraction with `HarvestBuilder::history_continue_as_new_deadline_fraction(f64)`
(clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]`). **No new event variant, no migration** — the nominal
deadline is derived from the recorded start time and the clock read reuses the
existing `SideEffectRecorded{Now}` event, so a history that crossed the deadline
replays to the same `continue_as_new` on every worker. See
`examples/long_lived_entity_deadline.rs`.

**Public `deadline()` is nominal; the CAN budget check accounts for pause
extensions.** For a run that was **paused/resumed** (#383) or redriven, the
engine pushes the run's *live* hard deadline (`deadline_at`, which the timeout
scanner enforces) forward past `start + execution_timeout`. The public
`ctx.deadline()`/`ctx.time_until_deadline()` deliberately stay on the **nominal**
`start + execution_timeout` — a replay-stable value you can branch on or embed in
an activity/child input without a non-deterministic divergence after a resume —
so they do **not** reflect pause extensions. The engine's **internal**
`should_continue_as_new()` budget check *does* read the live shifted deadline, so
a healthy run that was paused for a long time is not forced to checkpoint the
moment it resumes. **Contract:** whenever `should_continue_as_new()` returns
`true`, call `continue_as_new` (as above) rather than continuing to run — that is
what keeps the internal live-deadline read replay-safe.

**Call `should_continue_as_new()` once per decision cycle.** When the workflow
declares an `execution_timeout`, each `should_continue_as_new()` call reads the
deadline clock and records **one** `SideEffectRecorded{Now}` event on the live
frontier (a no-timeout workflow records nothing). Call it once at the top of a
decision cycle — not in a tight inner loop that fires it dozens of times per
cycle — or the history grows a `Now` event per call.

**Rollout is graceful — no "upgrade the fleet first" dance.** An in-flight
execution recorded *before* this feature shipped carries no deadline clock read
at the `should_continue_as_new()` call site. When it resumes under a
deadline-aware binary the deadline branch degrades to history-count-only for the
run's already-recorded portion (it does **not** nd-block), and it picks the
deadline feature up automatically once it executes live past its pre-upgrade
frontier. You can deploy the new binary while such runs are in flight without
any special sequencing. The engine's deadline clock read is recorded under a
reserved side-effect name, so it never consumes an author-side `ctx.system_now()`
/ `ctx.sleep_until()` `Now` — even a pre-upgrade history where the
`should_continue_as_new()` check sits immediately before a `ctx.system_now()`
call replays cleanly, with that `Now` matched by the workflow's own read rather
than the deadline probe.

**Per-run cap vs chain-scoped lifetime cap (`chain_execution_timeout`).** The
`execution_timeout` above bounds a **single run** — and it is **re-anchored on
every `continue_as_new`**, so a long-lived entity workflow that checkpoints and
continues forever never trips it. That is exactly right for a *healthy* run, but
it means `execution_timeout` alone cannot catch a **runaway loop that keeps
continuing-as-new** (a stuck poller, a bug that re-continues without making
progress). `chain_execution_timeout` is the bound for the *whole chain*:

```rust
// Per-run cap protects one run; chain cap protects the entire continue-as-new chain.
#[workflow(execution_timeout = "1h", chain_execution_timeout = "7d")]
async fn incremental_sync(ctx: &WorkflowContext, state: SyncState) -> Result<SyncState, String> {
    // ... one cycle of work; continue_as_new to the next cycle ...
    Ok(state)
}
```

- **`execution_timeout`** — bounds *one run*; **re-anchored** at each
  `continue_as_new` start. Reach for it to kill a single hung/runaway *attempt*.
- **`chain_execution_timeout`** — anchored at the **first** run's start and
  **carried verbatim** across every `continue_as_new`, so the deadline is the
  same absolute instant for run #1 and run #500 of the chain. Reach for it as a
  hard ceiling on total lifetime (SLA compliance, "this entity may live at most
  N days") and as **runaway protection** a continuing loop cannot escape.

When the chain cap elapses, the run is **terminated** (`TIMED_OUT`, the same
`WorkflowExecutionTimedOut` event as `execution_timeout`); the metric
`harvest.workflow.chain_timeout` distinguishes it from a per-run
`harvest.workflow.timeout`.

**Fleet-wide default — the builder ceiling doubles as a default (a deliberate
divergence from `execution_timeout`).** `HarvestBuilder::max_workflow_chain_timeout(d)`
both *caps* any workflow-declared `chain_execution_timeout` **and** acts as a
**fleet-wide default**: a workflow that declares no chain cap still inherits the
ceiling as its chain deadline. (This differs from
`max_workflow_execution_timeout`, which only caps a *specified* per-run timeout.)
So one builder call caps chains fleet-wide — even ones that under-specify:

```rust
HarvestBuilder::new()
    .max_workflow_chain_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30 * 24 * 3600)) // no chain outlives 30d, fleet-wide
    .build();
```

The ceiling-as-default is applied at these **origin** start paths: the plain
HTTP `POST /workflows/{name}/start`, signal-with-start, update-with-start, batch
start, trigger-now, workflow backfill, the scheduler tick (including its
**buffered** overlap-policy fires), and debounce/throttle/batch deferred starts.
(It is deliberately not applied on the CAN/retry/reset paths, which carry or
re-anchor the chain deadline by their own rules above.)

A few remaining origin start paths currently pass **no** chain cap and are
therefore **not** covered by the fleet-wide default — a documented limitation,
parity-consistent with their per-run `execution_timeout`-ceiling treatment (they
thread neither ceiling): **completion-trigger** starts, the **Vantage UI manual
schedule trigger**, the **webhook cross-shard outbox**, and **webhook-subscription**
starts. The **typed Rust client stub's** `signal_with_start` / `update_with_start`
are also uncovered (its `start` / `start_with_options` methods do apply the cap).
For any of these, declare the cap on the workflow type with
`#[workflow(chain_execution_timeout = "…")]`, or start via the HTTP route.

**Absolute wall-clock — not shifted by pause.** Unlike `deadline_at` /
`sla_deadline_at` (which resume pushes forward by the paused span),
`chain_deadline_at` is an absolute compliance/runaway bound and is **not**
extended by pause/resume. The chain cap is enforced by the timeout scanner only;
it is deliberately **not** exposed to `ctx.deadline()` /
`should_continue_as_new()` (which stay bound to the per-run deadline), so a
continuing loop cannot read it and route around it.

> **Operator callout — a long pause can kill a chain on resume.** Because
> `chain_deadline_at` is absolute and is *not* shifted forward by the paused

> compliance/investigation pause can therefore immediately terminate a chain the
> instant it resumes. If you need a run to survive a pause that outlasts its
> chain budget, cancel/terminate and restart with a fresh chain origin rather
> than pausing.

**Workflow versioning.** When you change an in-flight workflow's logic,
fence the divergence with `ctx.patched()` — the recommended default for the
overwhelmingly common two-state (before/after) change — so old executions
replay their recorded path while new executions take the new branch:

```rust
if ctx.patched("v2-tax-flow") {
    ctx.execute_activity_raw("compute_tax_v2", input, "default").await?;
} else {
    ctx.execute_activity_raw("compute_tax_v1", input, "default").await?;
}
```

Retire the gate with a three-deploy sequence:

1. **Introduce** — the `if ctx.patched(id) { new } else { old }` fence above.
   New executions record a `patch:{id}` marker and take the new branch;
   pre-patch executions keep replaying the old branch. One caveat: a fresh
   run whose first-task history ends in un-awaited signals at the gate point
   — canonically every **signal-with-start** run, whose signal is staged
   before first dispatch — takes the *old* branch and records no marker
   (deliberate parity with `ctx.version()`), so drain checks must count
   these marker-less runs too.
2. **Deprecate** — once every pre-patch run has drained (see the "Patched
   gates" section of `docs/runbooks/version-gate-retirement.md` — the
   runbook's `version-usage` / retirement-check CLI tooling only sees
   `version:` markers, **not** patch gates; use that section's raw SQL
   drain queries), replace the fence with `ctx.deprecate_patch(id);`
   followed by the unconditional new code. The recorded markers become
   transparent to replay, so marker-bearing runs still replay cleanly.
3. **Remove** — once every marker-bearing run has drained, delete the
   `deprecate_patch` call entirely.

`ctx.version()` remains the explicit escape hatch for gates that need **more
than two** concurrent versions:

```rust
if ctx.version("v2-tax-flow", 1, 3) >= 2 {
    // …
}
```

Histories recorded by a two-version `ctx.version(id, 1, 2)` gate interop with
`ctx.patched(id)` — the version marker is observed as patched, so you can
migrate a gate in place.

**Cron / interval schedules for workflows.** Register any workflow on a
schedule with `HarvestPlugin::schedule(...)`. When you need a graph of
activities instead of a single workflow on a schedule, jump to
[Chapter 8 — DAGs and schedules](/docs/harvest-dags-and-schedules).

**Search attributes.** Tag executions with structured fields
(`tenant_id`, `customer_id`) at start time so you can filter the dashboard
and the CLI by them: `harvest workflow list --search-attr tenant=acme`.
