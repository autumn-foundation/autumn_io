# SEO — `seo(...)`, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt`

A public web page needs three things before a search engine can index it well:

1. **Meta tags** in the `<head>` that give the page a title, a summary, and a
   preview card.
2. A **`sitemap.xml`** that lists every URL the crawler must visit.
3. A **`robots.txt`** that tells the crawler where it can go.

Autumn builds all three. You do three things:

- Declare the values that never change on the route attribute.
- Refine the values that change in the handler.
- Set the site base URL in `autumn.toml`.

The framework then mounts `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` for you.

> **Runnable example:** [`examples/reddit-clone`](../../examples/reddit-clone)
> wires the full feature. Its `src/seo.rs` holds the sitemap source and the
> canonical-URL helpers. Its `autumn.toml` holds the `[seo]` block. Its routes
> in `src/routes/` carry the `seo(...)` arguments.
> [`examples/blog`](../../examples/blog) shows the same feature on a
> locale-prefixed site.

---

## Turn the feature on

Set one value in `autumn.toml`:

```toml
[seo]
base_url = "https://example.com"
```

`base_url` does three jobs:

- It mounts `GET /robots.txt` and `GET /sitemap.xml`.
- It makes the absolute URLs that both documents need.
- It adds the `Sitemap:` line to `robots.txt`.

Set it to the real public host. A wrong `base_url` sends crawlers to URLs that
do not exist.

The routes also appear when you register a sitemap source (see
[Sitemap](#sitemapxml)). You do not need both.

---

## Meta tags on the route

Declare the values that never change on the route attribute. Add a `seo(...)`
argument, then take a `SeoMeta` parameter. The parameter arrives with the
declared values already in it.

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::prelude::*;

#[get(
    "/about",
    seo(
        title = "About • Autumn Reddit",
        description = "Why this site exists and what it demonstrates.",
        og_type = "website"
    )
)]
pub async fn about(seo: SeoMeta) -> Markup {
    layout_with_seo(seo, html! { h1 { "About" } })
}
```

Two rules govern the argument:

- Each value must be a string literal. The macro reads it at compile time.
- An unknown key or a repeated key is a compile error.

The argument gives the handler **values, not markup**. The handler still
chooses where to write them. A route that declares `seo(...)` but never takes a
`SeoMeta` parameter renders nothing.

The extractor never fails. A route without a `seo(...)` argument gives the
handler an empty builder, so you can add the parameter to any route.

### Where the argument works

| Macro | Accepts `seo(...)` |
|---|---|
| `#[get]`, `#[post]`, `#[put]`, `#[patch]`, `#[delete]` | yes |
| `#[static_get]` | yes — the pre-rendered HTML carries the tags |
| `#[ws]` | no — a WebSocket upgrade serves no crawlable page |

### The keys

Each key matches one `SeoMeta` builder method.

| Key | Tag it renders |
|---|---|
| `title` | `<title>` |
| `description` | `<meta name="description">` |
| `canonical` | `<link rel="canonical">` |
| `robots` | `<meta name="robots">` |
| `og_title`, `og_description`, `og_image`, `og_type`, `og_url` | `<meta property="og:…">` |
| `twitter_card`, `twitter_title`, `twitter_description`, `twitter_image` | `<meta name="twitter:…">` |

`SeoMeta::render` writes only the tags you set. It also fills three gaps for
you:

- `og:title` falls back to `title`.
- `og:description` falls back to `description`.
- `og:url` falls back to `canonical`.

The Twitter title and description fall back in the same way, but only when you
set `twitter_card`. Set each value one time and let the fallbacks do the rest.

Match the card type to what you have. Use `summary` until the page can supply
an `og_image`. A `summary_large_image` card with no image renders as a plain
link.

---

## Refine the values in the handler

A detail page cannot put its title on the attribute, because the title comes
from the database. Declare the fixed part on the attribute. Add the changing
part in the handler.

```rust,ignore
#[get(
    "/r/{sub_slug}/posts/{post_slug}",
    seo(og_type = "article", twitter_card = "summary")
)]
pub async fn show(
    Path((sub_slug, post_slug)): Path<(String, String)>,
    seo: SeoMeta,
    mut db: Db,
) -> AutumnResult<Markup> {
    let post = load_post(&mut db, &sub_slug, &post_slug).await?;

    let seo = seo
        .title(format!("{} • Autumn Reddit", post.title))
        .description(summarize(&post.body, 155));

    Ok(layout_with_seo(seo, html! { h1 { (post.title) } }))
}
```

`SeoMeta` is a normal builder. Each method takes the builder and returns it, so
you can chain the calls.

---

## Render the tags in your layout

`SeoMeta::render` returns Maud `Markup`. Put one call in the `<head>` of your
layout. Every page then gets the same treatment.

```rust,ignore
pub fn layout_with_seo(seo: SeoMeta, content: Markup) -> Markup {
    html! {
        (PreEscaped("<!DOCTYPE html>"))
        html lang="en" {
            head {
                meta charset="utf-8";
                meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1";
                (seo.render())
                link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/app.css";
            }
            body { main { (content) } }
        }
    }
}
```

`render` writes the `<title>` tag, so the layout must not write its own. Give
each page a title, or the page gets no title at all.

Keep the old plain-title entry point if your application has many pages. Let it
build a `SeoMeta` and call the new function:

```rust,ignore
pub fn layout(title: &str, content: Markup) -> Markup {
    layout_with_seo(SeoMeta::new().title(format!("{title} — Autumn Reddit")), content)
}
```

`examples/reddit-clone` uses this pattern in `src/routes/layout.rs`. Most of its
pages still call `layout`. Only the pages that need more tags call
`layout_with_seo`.

---

## Canonical URLs

A canonical tag names the one true address of a page. Add it when the same
content answers at more than one URL. Three common causes are:

- a second route that redirects to the first, such as `/posts/{id}`;
- a tracking parameter in the query string;
- a page that appears under both `/` and `/index`.

The tag must hold an absolute URL, so the handler needs `base_url` at run time.
Read it one time at start-up and keep it in a `OnceLock`:

```rust,ignore
static BASE_URL: OnceLock<Option<String>> = OnceLock::new();

pub fn init_base_url(config: &AutumnConfig) {
    let base = config.seo.base_url.as_deref()
        .map(|url| url.trim_end_matches('/').to_owned());
    let _ = BASE_URL.set(base);
}

#[must_use]
pub fn with_canonical(seo: SeoMeta, path: &str) -> SeoMeta {
    match BASE_URL.get().and_then(Option::as_deref) {
        Some(base) => seo.canonical(format!("{base}{path}")),
        None => seo,
    }
}
```

Call `init_base_url` in `main` before the application starts. Then wrap the
builder in each handler:

```rust,ignore
let seo = with_canonical(seo.title(post.title.clone()), &post_path);
```

The `AutumnConfig` extractor also reads the value, but it clones the whole
configuration on each request. The `OnceLock` costs one pointer read.

---

## Keep a page out of the index

Set `robots` on the route:

```rust,ignore
#[secured]
#[get("/submit", seo(title = "Submit a post", robots = "noindex, nofollow"))]
pub async fn submit_form(seo: SeoMeta) -> AutumnResult<Markup> { /* … */ }
```

The directive has two effects:

1. The page renders `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`.
2. The framework drops the page from `sitemap.xml`, but only for a
   `#[static_get]` route. See the next rule for why.

Autumn reads `noindex` as a comma-separated directive, so `"noindex"`,
`"noindex, nofollow"`, and `"nofollow, noindex"` all count. An unrelated value
such as `"noarchive"` does not.

Choose the second half of the directive on purpose. `noindex, follow` keeps the
page out of the index but lets crawlers walk its links, which is what a thin
profile page wants. `noindex, nofollow` stops both.

Do not also add the URL to `robots.txt`. See
[Do not use `Disallow` and `noindex` on the same URL](#do-not-use-disallow-and-noindex-on-the-same-url).

### The sitemap-exclusion rule

The framework filters only the paths it derives on its own. Those are the
concrete `#[static_get]` paths. It never filters the entries a sitemap source
supplies.

The reason is that a `SitemapEntry` carries only a URL string. Nothing ties the
entry back to a route, so the framework cannot match your URLs against your
route templates. It also must not drop a URL you asked for.

The practical result is one rule: **when you add a URL to a sitemap source, do
not also mark its route `noindex`.** Remove the URL from the source instead.

---

## `robots.txt`

The active profile sets the default:

| Profile | Body |
|---|---|
| `dev`, `test` | `User-agent: *` and `Disallow: /` |
| `prod`, `production` | `User-agent: *` and `Allow: /` |

Override the default and add your own rules under `[seo.robots]`:

```toml
[seo.robots]
# Force the answer, whatever the profile says. Use `false` on a staging host
# that runs the `prod` profile.
allow_all = false

# Extra lines. Autumn appends them after the User-agent block.
# Machine endpoints only. Read the next section before you add a page here.
additional_rules = [
  "Disallow: /actuator/",
  "Disallow: /api/",
  "Crawl-delay: 5",
]

# An explicit Sitemap: URL. Autumn computes it from `base_url` when you omit it.
sitemap_url = "https://cdn.example.com/sitemap.xml"
```

### Do not use `Disallow` and `noindex` on the same URL

The two rules do different jobs, and they cancel each other out:

- `robots.txt` stops the **crawl**.
- `noindex` stops the **indexing**.

A crawler must fetch a page to read its `noindex` tag. A `Disallow` line stops
that fetch, so the crawler never reads the tag. The damage goes further. A page
that another site links to can still enter the index without a crawl. The URL
then appears as a bare result, and you have no way to remove it.

Pick one tool for each URL:

| Goal | Use |
|---|---|
| Keep the URL out of the index | Allow the crawl. Serve `seo(robots = "noindex")`. |
| Keep crawlers off a machine endpoint | `Disallow` it. Accept that URL-only indexing stays possible. |

A `noindex` tag also has to be reachable. A page behind `#[secured]` answers an
anonymous crawler with a redirect to the login form. The crawler never sees the
tag on the page itself. Put the directive where a crawler can read it, or send
an `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header on the redirect.

---

## `sitemap.xml`

Autumn builds the document from two sources.

### 1. Static routes, derived for you

The framework adds one entry for each `#[static_get]` path when `base_url` is
set. It skips a path that holds a `{` placeholder, because a template is not a
URL.

### 2. A `SitemapSource` you register

Every other URL comes from your application. Implement `SitemapSource` and
register it on the builder:

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::seo::{SitemapChangefreq, SitemapEntry, SitemapSource};
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;

struct PostSitemapSource {
    pool: Option<Pool<RuntimeConnection>>,
}

impl SitemapSource for PostSitemapSource {
    fn entries(&self) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Vec<SitemapEntry>> + Send + '_>> {
        Box::pin(async {
            vec![
                SitemapEntry::new("https://example.com/posts/hello")
                    .lastmod("2026-05-01")
                    .changefreq(SitemapChangefreq::Weekly)
                    .priority(0.6),
            ]
        })
    }
}

// In main():
autumn_web::app()
    .seo_source(PostSitemapSource { pool })
    .run()
    .await;
```

Each entry holds one URL and three optional hints:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `loc` | The absolute URL. Autumn escapes the XML characters for you. |
| `lastmod` | The last change date, as `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `changefreq` | `Always`, `Hourly`, `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Monthly`, `Yearly`, or `Never`. |
| `priority` | A number from 0.0 to 1.0. Autumn clamps it. |

### Read the database in a source

The application state does not exist when the framework collects the entries,
so a source cannot use the `Db` extractor. Build a pool of its own from the
configuration:

```rust,ignore
let pool = autumn_web::db::create_pool(&config.database)?;
let source = PostSitemapSource { pool };
```

`examples/reddit-clone/src/seo.rs` does this. It lists the communities and the
posts.

Cap the number of entries, and log a warning when the cap bites, so a partial
sitemap is never a silent one.

Know what a `LIMIT` bounds. It bounds the size of the document. It does not
bound the work: a database must read every candidate row before it can know
which rows are newest. Boot time therefore grows with the table. That is
acceptable while the table is small. Past that point, stop building the sitemap
at boot and serve `/sitemap.xml` from your own route, as
[The entries are a start-up snapshot](#the-entries-are-a-start-up-snapshot)
describes.

### Give `lastmod` the page, not one column

`lastmod` tells a crawler whether it must fetch the page again. It must
therefore describe the whole page. One timestamp column rarely does.

A post page is its body plus its comment thread. An edit advances
`posts.updated_at`. A new comment does not: it writes a different table
through a different route. A `lastmod` read straight from `posts.updated_at`
therefore tells the crawler nothing changed, and the new comments stay out of
the index.

You have two ways to fix that:

1. **Write** the timestamp from each subsystem that changes the page.
2. **Derive** it in the sitemap query.

Prefer the second. One query then owns the definition, and no write path has
to remember to take part:

```sql
SELECT GREATEST(
           p.updated_at,
           COALESCE(MAX(c.created_at) FILTER (WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL), p.updated_at),
           COALESCE(MAX(c.deleted_at), p.updated_at)
       ) AS last_modified
  FROM posts p
  LEFT JOIN comments c
         ON c.commentable_type = 'Post'
        AND c.commentable_id = p.id
 GROUP BY p.id
 ORDER BY last_modified DESC
```

Two details in that query earn their place:

- **Match the discriminator.** A `#[commentable]` table is polymorphic, so
  `commentable_id` is unique only with `commentable_type`. Without the type,
  a comment on community 7 moves post 7's date.
- **Count a deletion too.** A removed comment changes the page as much as a
  new one. Filter the deleted rows out of the *aggregate*, not out of the
  *join*: drop them in the join and the date can move backward when somebody
  deletes the newest reply.

Order on the derived value, not on the column. Your entry cap cuts the list,
and it must cut the pages that really are the oldest.

Leave out the changes a reader does not come for. A vote count is one of them.
Search engines ask you not to advertise a trivial change. A sitemap that moves
every date on every vote also teaches crawlers to distrust all of its dates.

Handle a query failure inside the source. Log the failure and return the
entries you have. A short sitemap is better than a failed boot.

### The entries are a start-up snapshot

Autumn calls `entries()` one time, while it builds the router. It renders the
result into a fixed response body. Two things follow:

- The route costs nothing to serve. It writes one cached string.
- The sitemap does not change until the next deploy or restart.

That trade suits most sites, because a crawler reads the file hours after a
deploy. When your site must list new content at once, register your own route
instead:

```rust,ignore
#[get("/sitemap.xml")]
async fn sitemap(mut db: Db) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let entries = load_entries(&mut db).await;
    (
        [("Content-Type", "application/xml; charset=utf-8")],
        autumn_web::seo::sitemap_xml(&entries, Some("https://example.com")),
    )
}
```

Autumn sees the collision, logs a warning, and mounts neither of its own SEO
routes. Your route wins. Serve `/robots.txt` yourself as well in that case, or
build its body with `autumn_web::seo::robots_txt`.

### The 50,000-URL limit

The sitemap protocol allows 50,000 URLs in one file. `sitemap_xml` serves the
first 50,000 entries and logs a warning for the rest. A larger site needs a
sitemap index, which is a file that points at several sitemap files. Build the
index in your own `/sitemap.xml` route.

---

## Locale-prefixed sites

Turn on locale-prefixed routing in `autumn.toml`:

```toml
[i18n]
locale_prefix_enabled = true
supported_locales = ["en", "es"]
```

Autumn then writes one sitemap entry per locale for each derived static path.
`/about` becomes `https://example.com/en/about` and
`https://example.com/es/about`.

Tell the crawler which URLs are translations of each other with `hreflang`
links. `locale_alternates` builds the pairs, and `hreflang_alternates` renders
them:

```rust,ignore
use autumn_web::seo::{SeoMeta, locale_alternates};

#[get("/posts", seo(title = "Posts"))]
async fn index(locale: Locale, seo: SeoMeta) -> Markup {
    let seo = seo.hreflang_alternates(locale_alternates(
        "https://example.com",
        "/posts",
        "en",
        &["en".to_owned(), "es".to_owned()],
    ));
    html! { head { (seo.render()) } }
}
```

The function adds an `x-default` pair that points at the default locale. Pass
the locale-stripped path, which is what the `Uri` extractor gives you inside a
locale-prefixed nest.

Two exclusions apply, and both keep the sitemap in step with the router:

- Autumn excludes `#[static_get]` routes from locale prefixing, because
  pre-rendering requests one unprefixed path. Such a route stays one entry.
- Autumn lists a path from `[i18n] locale_prefix_exclude` without a prefix.

A `SitemapSource` entry is your own text. Autumn never rewrites it, so add the
locale prefix yourself. `examples/blog` shows both halves.

---

## Static builds

`autumn build` writes `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` into the output directory
next to the pre-rendered pages. It uses the same configuration and the same
sources as the server, so the two agree.

The build never overwrites a file your own routes already produced. A
`#[static_get("/robots.txt")]` route therefore wins, and the build prints a
line that says it skipped the file.

---

## Test it

Start the application and read the two documents:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/robots.txt
curl http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | grep -E '<title>|og:|canonical'
```

In a test, assert on the rendered markup:

```rust,ignore
#[test]
fn post_page_declares_its_canonical_url() {
    let seo = SeoMeta::new()
        .title("hello • Autumn Reddit")
        .canonical("https://example.com/r/rust/posts/hello")
        .og_type("article");

    let html = layout_with_seo(seo, html! {}).into_string();

    assert!(html.contains(r#"<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/r/rust/posts/hello">"#));
    assert!(html.contains(r#"<meta property="og:type" content="article">"#));
}
```

`examples/reddit-clone` carries two suites:

- `src/routes/layout.rs` asserts the rendered tags. It needs no database.
- `tests/seo_pg_integration.rs` seeds a Postgres, runs the sitemap source, and
  asserts the URLs and the `lastmod` values. Run it with:

  ```bash
  cargo test -p reddit-clone --test seo_pg_integration -- --ignored
  ```

---

## Checklist

1. Set `[seo] base_url` to the real public host.
2. Put `(seo.render())` in the `<head>` of your layout.
3. Declare a `title` and a `description` on each public route.
4. Add a canonical URL on each page that answers at more than one address.
5. Mark each page you want out of the index `robots = "noindex"`, and leave
   that URL out of `robots.txt`.
6. Register a `SitemapSource` for the pages the framework cannot derive.
7. Read `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` before you deploy.
