# Idempotency for safe retries



Activities are at-least-once. If the worker crashes after Stripe accepts a
charge but before the engine writes `ActivityCompleted` to Postgres, the
retry will charge the customer again unless the downstream system
deduplicates. Every activity gets a stable, retry-safe key from
`ctx.idempotency_key()`:

```rust
#[activity(start_to_close = "30s", retry = RetryPolicy::exponential(3, Duration::from_secs(2)))]
async fn charge_card(
    ctx: &ActivityContext,
    input: serde_json::Value,
) -> HarvestResult<serde_json::Value> {
    let amount_cents = input["amount_cents"].as_u64().unwrap_or(0);
    let customer_id = input["customer_id"].as_str().unwrap_or("").to_owned();

    let idem_key = ctx.idempotency_key()?.as_str().to_owned();

    // Pass idem_key as Stripe's Idempotency-Key header. Subsequent retries
    // for this attempt carry the same key, so Stripe returns the original
    // charge instead of creating a new one.
    let charge_id = stripe_charge(amount_cents, &customer_id, &idem_key)
        .await
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    Ok(serde_json::json!({ "charge_id": charge_id }))
}
```

The key is stable across worker restarts, duplicate dispatch, and replay,
**but it's distinct for every logical invocation** — calling `charge_card`
twice for two different orders gets two different keys.

For activities that make several outbound calls, derive named subkeys:

```rust
let key = ctx.idempotency_key()?;
create_db_user(&user_id, key.subkey("db").as_str()).await?;
send_welcome_email(&user_id, key.subkey("email").as_str()).await?;
```

## Idempotent signal delivery

Idempotency also matters in the other direction: webhook and event sources
(Stripe, GitHub, SQS) deliver **at-least-once**, so the same logical event can
reach a running workflow twice. Supplying an idempotency key with the signal
collapses duplicate deliveries into exactly one `SignalReceived` event — no
hand-rolled "seen event ids" dedup set in the workflow body (issues #521/#753):

- **HTTP** — `POST /workflows/{id}/signal/{signal_name}` with an
  `Idempotency-Key:` header (or `?idempotency_key=` query param; the header
  wins when both are present).
- **CLI** — `harvest workflow signal <exec-id> <name> --idempotency-key <key>`.
- **Typed client stub** — the `#[signal]` macro generates a
  `signal_{name}_idempotent(...)` sibling method.
- **Untyped client** — `signal::send_signal_idempotent(conn, exec_id, name,
  payload, Some(key))`.
- **First delivery for a workflow** — `signal-with-start` carries its own
  `idempotency_key` field (issue #244); the surfaces above cover the
  steady-state "signal an already-running workflow" case.

Dedupe scope is per execution — `(execution_id, idempotency_key)` — so the
same upstream event id may safely target different executions. A deduplicated
delivery returns 2xx with `signal_delivered: false` — deliberately even when
the execution has since gone terminal, as long as the key originally landed
while the run was still active (a retry acknowledges a delivery that already
happened; a fresh key or an unkeyed signal to a terminal run still gets the
terminal error). Omitting the key preserves the legacy at-least-once behavior
exactly. Full contract and curl examples:

## Idempotent workflow start — `idempotency_key` vs `workflow_id` (issue #808)

The same at-least-once problem hits the **start** path: a webhook or event
source that retries `POST /workflows/{name}/start` would launch a redundant
execution on every redelivery. Two knobs deduplicate a start, and they answer
**different questions**:

| | `workflow_id` (business identity) | `idempotency_key` (delivery identity) |
|---|---|---|
| Answers | "Is this the *same logical run*?" | "Is this the *same request*?" |
| Dedup scope | `(workflow_name, workflow_id)` via the `reuse_policy` matrix | `(workflow_name, idempotency_key)`, **independent of `workflow_id`** |
| Works when `workflow_id` is auto-generated per request | No (each request is a new id) | **Yes** — that's the point |
| On a duplicate | Depends on `reuse_policy` (may `409`, attach, or start fresh) | Always a `200` no-op returning the **same** `execution_id` |

`idempotency_key` is checked **first** and short-circuits the `reuse_policy`
matrix entirely. Supply it out-of-band via the `Idempotency-Key` request header
(preferred — the raw body stays your workflow input) or the body
`idempotency_key` field; the header wins when both are present.

To have a replay recognized when the retry body may not deserialize (for
example a field was tightened between deliveries), supply the key in the
`Idempotency-Key` **header** — the header is honored independently of body
validity. A key supplied only in the body `idempotency_key` field requires the
request body to be structurally valid (deserializable) to be recognized on
retry, since the body must be parsed to read it. This mirrors the standard
reason idempotency keys are delivered via a header.

```bash
# First delivery — creates the run (201, started_fresh: true).
curl -X POST /api/harvest/workflows/onboarding/start \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: webhook-evt-abc123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input": {"user_id": 42}}'

# Retry (same key) — no-op returning the SAME execution_id
# (200, deduplicated: true, no second WorkflowStarted, no second task).
curl -X POST /api/harvest/workflows/onboarding/start \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: webhook-evt-abc123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input": {"user_id": 42}}'
```

Semantics:

- **Exactly one execution** even under N simultaneous same-key starts
  (concurrency-safe by a composite-PK upsert).
- **Retention window** (default 24h, `HarvestBuilder::start_idempotency_window`):
  after it elapses the key is reusable and starts a fresh run.
- **Byte-identical when unused** — a start with no key omits the
  `started_fresh`/`deduplicated` response fields entirely.
- **A committed keyed replay short-circuits to the `200` no-op _before_
  fresh-start-only validations** — input-schema validation (#373),
  completion-callback SSRF validation (#605), and the delay/`start_at` checks —
  **and before the admission gate** (#377). Tightening any of those rules (or
  raising a gate during an incident) between the original delivery and a retry
  never rejects a retry of already-done work; the retry returns the original
  execution regardless of its own body. A genuinely fresh keyed start (no live
  claim) still runs every validation and the gate normally.
- **A committed keyed replay survives a malformed body when the key is in the
  `Idempotency-Key` header.** Because the body is irrelevant on a key hit, a
  retry whose JSON body no longer deserializes (a client- or server-side shape
  change after the original delivery) still returns the `200` no-op rather than
  the JSON extractor's `400`/`422`. **Residual:** with a malformed body the
  `workflow_id` is unknown, so this fallback can only probe the claim by
  **key-routing**; a committed replay whose *original* delivery supplied an
  explicit `workflow_id` (and was therefore routed to — and claimed on — the
  `workflow_id`-derived shard) is not found by the key-routed fallback and still
  returns the extractor rejection. This is safe (never a false dedup, never a
  duplicate run) and narrow: the common header-key usage omits `workflow_id`
  (auto-generated), which routes by the key and *is* found. A malformed body with
  **no** key returns the exact extractor rejection unchanged. A well-behaved
  client sends a consistent, valid body on retries.
- **Empty key → `400`**; **combining a key with a throttle/debounce/batch
  policy → `400`** (those defer the start and expose no synchronous
  `execution_id` to converge on).
- Shard-local, and it introduces **no new event** — the dedup happens before
  `WorkflowStarted` is ever appended, so replay is unaffected.

### Consistency caveat in multi-shard deployments

The claim row and its execution are **shard-local**, so a keyed start's shard is
chosen deterministically from either the key or the `workflow_id`:

- **`workflow_id` omitted** (auto-generated): the start routes by the **key**
  `(workflow_name, idempotency_key)`. Same-key retries co-locate on one shard and
  dedup — routing by the per-request `workflow_id` would scatter them. The server
  also **mints** the auto-generated `workflow_id` onto that same key-shard (by
  bounded rejection sampling), so a later request that reuses the *returned*
  `workflow_id` explicitly (a client echo, or a `reject_duplicate` start on that
  id) routes via `(workflow_name, workflow_id)` back to the shard the execution
  lives on and sees it — preserving the shard-local `(workflow_name, workflow_id)`
  uniqueness invariant.
- **`workflow_id` supplied** (explicit business identity): the start routes by
  `(workflow_name, workflow_id)`, exactly as a non-keyed start does. This keeps
  the run on the shard that owns `(name, workflow_id)`, so the `reuse_policy`
  matrix and the `(name, workflow_id)` uniqueness invariant still apply — a keyed
  `reject_duplicate` start still `409`s against an existing run, and never
  silently creates a second run on a different shard. Same-`workflow_id` retries
  still co-locate (the `workflow_id` is constant) and dedup on the key.

For keyed dedup to converge in a multi-shard deployment, a client must supply a
**consistent `workflow_id`** — the *same* explicit value, or consistently
*omit* it and let the server auto-generate — **across all retries of the same
delivery**. A retry that carries a *different* explicit `workflow_id` is not a
retry of the same logical delivery: it changes the business identity, can route
to a different shard-local claim table, and may create a second run. This is
inherent to shard-local dedup coexisting with the `(workflow_name, workflow_id)`
reuse matrix — keyed starts with an explicit `workflow_id` route by
`workflow_id` (so the `reuse_policy` matrix still sees an existing run on that
identity's shard), and keyed starts with an omitted/auto-generated `workflow_id`
route by the key. Routing *all* keyed starts by the key instead would break the
reuse matrix for explicit-`workflow_id` starts whose existing run lives on the
`workflow_id` shard (the matrix could no longer see it, silently creating a
duplicate). The two placements cannot both be satisfied when the key and the
`workflow_id` hash to different shards, and #808 scopes dedup as shard-local with
no cross-shard probe — so the requirement is on the client: pick one
`workflow_id` shape *and value* per delivery. In a single-shard deployment this
is all moot (everything is on one shard).

### Known limitation — shard drain within the retention window

Keyed dedup routes via the **same rendezvous hash + writable-subset redirect**
as `(workflow_name, workflow_id)` uniqueness (`pick_for_idempotency_key` reuses
the identical logic as `pick_for_new_workflow`). Because of that, it is **not
guaranteed across a writable → read-only shard transition** within a key's
retention window: a key that first claimed a run on a shard which is *later*
removed from the writable set (drained to read-only, but still readable) will,
on a same-key retry, rehash to a *different* writable shard, probe/reserve a
different shard-local `harvest_start_idempotency` row, and can create a **second**
execution. This is the same drain limitation `(name, workflow_id)` uniqueness
already has (a drained-shard uniqueness key can likewise be re-created on a
different writable shard), and issue #808 deliberately scopes keyed dedup to be
shard-local, exactly as that uniqueness is — so the two share identical behavior.
The guarantee holds while the **writable set is stable**; do not drain a writable
shard to read-only while keyed starts targeting it are still within their
retention window.
