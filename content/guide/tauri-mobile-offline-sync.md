# Offline Sync for Tauri Mobile: Local SQLite + Background Sync (`autumn generate tauri-mobile --offline-sync`)

`autumn generate tauri-mobile --offline-sync` layers **local-first storage**
onto the in-process mobile scaffold from
[docs/guide/tauri-mobile-in-process.md](tauri-mobile-in-process.md): app data
lives in a SQLite file inside the app sandbox (`autumn_web::sync::SyncStore`),
and a background `SyncEngine` pushes and pulls changes to your **remote
Autumn deployment's `/sync` endpoints** whenever the network allows. The app
functions fully offline **for its `SyncStore`-backed data** — reads, writes,
deletes — and converges with the remote PostgreSQL database in the
background when connection is restored (issue #1508, "Option C"). Data that
still lives in diesel repositories keeps needing the remote database — see
§8.

This is a different network model than the plain `tauri-mobile` scaffold:

| | `tauri-mobile` (default) | `tauri-mobile --offline-sync` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device data | remote Postgres, per query | local SQLite (`SyncStore`) |
| Network needed | for every DB-backed request | only to sync, in the background |
| Device DB credentials | Postgres URL in the shell | **none** — HTTPS to `/sync` |
| Remote deployment | any Postgres | the same app, serving `/sync` |

This page covers:

1. the architecture (what runs where),
2. the data model and change tracking (write-through journal),
3. sync semantics (server-authoritative versions, push/pull, idempotency),
4. conflict resolution (default last-write-wins, custom `ConflictResolver`),
5. tombstones, garbage collection, and full resync,
6. what the generator emits (drift-checked against the real templates),
7. the offline showcase walkthrough (airplane-mode checklist),
8. failure modes and limitations.

The sync engine itself lives in the `autumn-web` crate behind the
**`offline-sync`** cargo feature (`autumn_web::sync`); everything below also
applies to non-Tauri occasionally-connected clients.

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **same generated app codebase** plays both roles. Deployed on a server
whose resolved config has a database URL (config file, profile, or
`AUTUMN_DATABASE__URL`) — and with `SYNC_TOKEN` set, since the mount fails
closed without auth (§6) — `serve()` mounts the `/sync` router backed by
Postgres shadow tables. Running in-process on a device with no database
configured, the mounting is skipped and the app is a sync **client**:
routes talk to the local `SyncStore`, and the shell's background engine
reconciles it with the remote.

**Ordering is server-authoritative.** Every accepted change is assigned a
monotonically increasing version — a change sequence number (CSN) — from one
global Postgres sequence. Clients pull "rows with `version > my cursor`";
device wall clocks never order the change feed (they are consulted only
inside the conflict resolver, between the two conflicting writes — see §4).

## 2. Data model and change tracking

`SyncStore` is a document-flavored store: rows are JSON payloads keyed by
`(collection, pk)`. Any `serde::Serialize`/`DeserializeOwned` type works:

```rust
use autumn_web::sync::SyncStore;

let store = SyncStore::open(std::env::var("AUTUMN_SYNC__DB_PATH")?)?;

store.put("notes", "6b3f2c1e-…", &note)?;           // insert or update
let note: Option<Note> = store.get("notes", "6b3f2c1e-…")?;
let all: Vec<(String, Note)> = store.list("notes")?; // pk-ordered, no tombstones
store.delete("notes", "6b3f2c1e-…")?;                // tombstone + journal
let pending = store.pending_count()?;                // journaled, unsynced changes
```

Two rules make the model sync-safe:

- **Client-generated primary keys** — always UUIDs (or similarly unique
  strings), never serial integers. Two offline devices must be able to
  create rows concurrently without colliding.
- **Additive schema evolution** — payloads are JSON; give new fields
  `#[serde(default)]`-compatible semantics so old rows (and rows written by
  not-yet-updated devices) still deserialize.

**Change tracking is write-through, not trigger-based.** Every `put`/`delete`
writes the row *and* appends an entry to a pending-change **journal in the
same SQLite transaction** — a crash can never lose a journal entry or record
a change that didn't happen. Journal entries per `(collection, pk)` are
coalesced (the latest state wins) but keep the **original** `base_version`,
so a conflict with a remote write is still detected even after ten local
edits. The store also persists a stable per-install `device_id` (UUID v4)
and the pull `cursor`.

The SQLite file uses WAL mode with a busy timeout, and every write runs in
an immediate (write-locking) transaction. Within one `SyncStore` instance,
all clones share one serialized connection — **open the store once and
clone it** (clones are cheap; see the `OnceLock` pattern in §7). Separate
`SyncStore::open` calls on the same file are also safe — cross-connection
writers queue on the busy timeout — but each `open` pays connection and
schema setup, so don't open per request.

## 3. Sync semantics: push, pull, idempotency

One `SyncEngine::sync_once()` pass does:

1. **Push** — send journaled changes in batches
   (`POST /sync/push`, body `{device_id, changes: [...]}`). The server
   applies each batch **atomically** (one Postgres transaction, serialized
   across devices by an advisory lock so versions become visible in order)
   and answers per change: `applied {version}`, `already_applied {version}`,
   or `resolved {row}` (a conflict was settled — see §4). Confirmed entries
   are cleared from the journal; a resolved row is applied locally so the
   device converges immediately.
2. **Pull** — page through `GET /sync/pull?cursor=N&limit=M&session=S`
   (`S` is the cursor the catch-up started from, so a multi-page first
   sync is never mistaken for a stale client — see §5) and apply every row
   newer than the local cursor, then advance the cursor. Rows with a
   *pending local change* are skipped — local edits win locally until the
   push settles them (the server remains the authority on the final state).

Delivery is **at-least-once**: every journal entry carries a
client-generated `change_id`, and the server dedups per
`(scope, device_id, change_id)` in `autumn_sync_applied`. A retry after a lost
response returns `already_applied` with the originally assigned version
(so the client can record the ack it never received) and never
double-applies. `SyncBackend::gc_applied(older_than)` prunes old dedup
records; keep its retention longer than any device's plausible offline
retry horizon. Batches are bounded server-side (at most 1000 changes per
push, pull pages clamped to 1000 rows).

The background loop (`spawn_background(interval)`) runs `sync_once` every
30 s (as generated), backing off exponentially — 1 s doubling to a 5 min
ceiling — while the server is unreachable. A transport error leaves local
state and the journal untouched; the app keeps working offline and the next
successful pass converges. The generated shell additionally triggers an
immediate pass when the app returns to the foreground (§6).

## 4. Conflict resolution

A conflict is detected at push time by **base-version mismatch**: the change
says "I was based on version 7" but the server row is at version 9. The
resolver runs **server-side** — one authority, no distributed convergence
protocol:

```rust
pub trait ConflictResolver: Send + Sync {
    fn resolve(&self, client_device_id: &str, client: &Change, server: &RemoteRow) -> Resolution;
}

pub enum Resolution {
    KeepServer,                  // client's write loses
    TakeClient,                  // client's write wins
    Merge(serde_json::Value),    // synthesize a merged payload
}
```

The default `LwwResolver` is **last-write-wins** on the two writes'
`updated_at`, with the device id as a deterministic tiebreak: on an exact
timestamp tie, the write from the **lexicographically greater** device id
wins. The clock
caveat is confined and explicit: wall clocks compare only the *two
conflicting writes* (a device with a wrong clock can win one conflict, not
reorder the world), and you can replace the policy entirely. A field-merge
example:

```rust
use autumn_web::sync::{Change, ConflictResolver, RemoteRow, Resolution};

/// Field-level merge: keep the server row, overlay the client's fields.
struct FieldMergeResolver;

impl ConflictResolver for FieldMergeResolver {
    fn resolve(&self, _device: &str, client: &Change, server: &RemoteRow) -> Resolution {
        let (Some(client_payload), Some(server_payload)) = (&client.payload, &server.payload)
        else {
            return Resolution::KeepServer; // a delete is involved
        };
        let mut merged = server_payload.clone();
        if let (Some(merged_map), Some(client_map)) =
            (merged.as_object_mut(), client_payload.as_object())
        {
            for (key, value) in client_map {
                merged_map.insert(key.clone(), value.clone());
            }
        }
        Resolution::Merge(merged)
    }
}
```

Pass it where the generated `serve()` builds the router:
`server::router(backend, Arc::new(FieldMergeResolver))`.

**Convergence guarantee:** every resolution — even `KeepServer` — assigns
the row a **new** version, so all devices (including the conflict loser)
receive the settled state on their next pull.

## 5. Tombstones, GC, and full resync

Deletes never physically remove a synced row on the server: they write a
**tombstone** (`deleted = true`), which is just another versioned row in the
change feed — that is how a delete on one device propagates to every other
device instead of silently resurrecting on the next push.

Tombstones accumulate. `SyncBackend::gc_tombstones(up_to)` physically drops
tombstones with `version <= up_to` and advances each affected scope's
**`tombstone_horizon`** in `autumn_sync_horizons` to the highest tombstone
version actually dropped in that scope. Horizons are **per scope**, so one
tenant's GC never forces another tenant's resyncs or overrides its conflict
resolution — and the per-scope value never runs ahead of the change feed (a
dropped row is a committed row; GC also serializes with pushes via the same
advisory lock), so a maintenance job may pass an arbitrarily large `up_to`
(e.g. `i64::MAX`) to mean "everything so far" without pushing client
cursors past rows they have not seen. GC is an explicit server-side
operation (a job or admin task you schedule); it is **off by default**.

The horizon exists to keep long-offline clients correct: a client whose
sync session *started* behind the horizon might have missed a tombstone
that no longer exists, so the server answers its pull with
**`FullResyncRequired`** instead of a page of rows. The engine handles this
transparently — and safely: it first fetches the **complete** from-zero
snapshot, and only then reconciles local state against it in one
transaction (**pending local changes are preserved** and replayed; synced
rows absent from the snapshot are dropped). Nothing local is touched until
the snapshot has fully arrived, so a connection lost mid-resync leaves the
device's data intact and the resync re-triggers on the next pass. Pick a
GC cadence that makes this rare — e.g. GC tombstones older than 30 days if
your fleet syncs at least monthly.

Two details make the horizon check safe in the corner cases:

- The staleness decision keys on the **session-start cursor** (the
  `session=` query parameter every page of one catch-up repeats), never on
  intermediate page cursors — a fresh device paging its first sync through
  rows below the horizon is *not* stale and completes normally.
- After a completed catch-up the engine persists
  `max(next_cursor, tombstone_horizon)`, so a horizon that sits above the
  newest surviving row (normal when the last change before GC was a
  delete) cannot re-trigger a resync on every pass. At the same point the
  engine prunes local tombstones the server has already GC'd.

Pair `gc_tombstones` with `gc_applied` (see §3) so the dedup table is
bounded too.

One more corner the horizon guards: a device offline past a GC can still
**push** an edit based on the deleted row's old version (pushes run before
the pull that would demand a resync). The row is gone and its tombstone
GC'd, but the pre-horizon `base_version` claim dates the edit — the server
answers with a **deterministic server-winning tombstone** instead of
silently recreating the row. The conflict resolver is deliberately
**bypassed** for this shape: the deleted row's payload and deletion time
were GC'd, so any resolver input would be fabricated — and a clock-based
policy could be gamed by a device with a fast clock. The pusher converges
on the delete via its `Resolved` outcome. Genuinely new inserts
(`base_version = 0`) are unaffected — re-creating the row deliberately is
done with a fresh insert.

## 6. What the generator emits

Run it on an app that already has (or alongside) the mobile scaffold:

```bash
autumn generate tauri-mobile --offline-sync    # or --dry-run to preview
```

On top of the base scaffold (see
[tauri-mobile-in-process.md](tauri-mobile-in-process.md)) the flag makes
four template changes. Every snippet below is drift-checked against the real
generator output by `autumn-cli`'s test suite.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Set by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTUMN_SYNC__DB_PATH` | the shell, in `setup()` | absolute path of the local SQLite sync database (app sandbox); your routes read it to open the same `SyncStore` (once — see §7) |
| `AUTUMN_SYNC__REMOTE_URL` | **you**, in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` | base URL of the remote `/sync` mount (no trailing slash); if unset the app runs offline-only. **Always `https://` in production** — pushes carry your data and pulls return everyone's |
| `AUTUMN_SYNC__TOKEN` | **you**, in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (from your login/auth flow — never hard-coded) | the device's sync credential, sent as `Authorization: Bearer …`; must equal the deployment's `SYNC_TOKEN`. If unset the engine syncs uncredentialed and the fail-closed server mount answers `401` |
| `SYNC_TOKEN` | your **server** deployment only | shared secret guarding the generated `/sync` mount. **Fail closed:** when unset, `serve()` refuses to mount `/sync` at all (a startup warning explains) instead of exposing it open |
| `AUTUMN_DATABASE__URL` | your **server** deployment only | one way to give the server a database. `serve()` mounts `/sync` when its **resolved config** has a database URL (config files, profiles, or this env var); keep the device's config database-free |

These are template/deployment conventions — the engine itself takes plain
constructor arguments, so non-Tauri clients can wire it however they like.

### The app crate: feature + server-side `/sync` mounting

`Cargo.toml` gains an `offline-sync` feature
(`offline-sync = ["autumn-web/offline-sync"]`), included in `default` so a
plain `cargo run` server deployment serves `/sync`. The extracted
`src/lib.rs::serve()` mounts the router just before `.run()`:

<!-- drift:src/lib.rs -->
```rust
    #[cfg(feature = "offline-sync")]
    let app = mount_offline_sync(app).await;
```

backed by this generated helper — note the three load-bearing decisions:
the **database guard** (no database in the app's resolved config → sync
client, `/sync` not mounted), the **fail-closed auth gate** (no
`SYNC_TOKEN` → `/sync` not mounted, never exposed open — see §6), and
**startup tolerance** (an unreachable database logs a warning instead of
aborting the boot):

<!-- drift:src/lib.rs -->
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "offline-sync")]
async fn mount_offline_sync(app: autumn_web::app::AppBuilder) -> autumn_web::app::AppBuilder {
    use std::sync::Arc;

    use autumn_web::reexports::{axum, tokio};
    use autumn_web::sync::{LwwResolver, PgSyncBackend, server};

    // Diagnostics below use stderr: this helper runs BEFORE AppBuilder::run()
    // installs the tracing subscriber, so tracing events here would be lost.
    //
    // The database URL is resolved through the SAME layered configuration
    // the app itself boots with (autumn.toml, profile files, and the
    // AUTUMN_DATABASE__URL / AUTUMN_DATABASE__PRIMARY_URL env overrides) —
    // not from one raw env var. Caveat: a custom loader installed via
    // `with_config_loader` is NOT consulted here; deployments that must
    // serve /sync need their database URL visible to AutumnConfig::load().
    let database_url = match autumn_web::config::AutumnConfig::load() {
        Ok(config) => config.database.effective_primary_url().map(str::to_owned),
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("offline-sync: config load failed ({e}); /sync not mounted");
            return app;
        }
    };
    let Some(database_url) = database_url else {
        eprintln!(
            "offline-sync: no database is configured — running as a \
             sync client only; the remote deployment serves /sync"
        );
        return app;
    };
    // FAIL CLOSED: a database is configured, so this process is the sync
    // SERVER — but without a shared secret the endpoints would be open to
    // anyone who can reach them. Refuse to mount rather than expose them.
    if !std::env::var("SYNC_TOKEN").is_ok_and(|token| !token.is_empty()) {
        // ... eprintln! warning: /sync NOT mounted — set SYNC_TOKEN ...
        // ... (devices send the same secret via AUTUMN_SYNC__TOKEN) ...
        return app;
    }
    let backend = Arc::new(PgSyncBackend::new(database_url));
    // Idempotent DDL for the sync shadow tables. A temporarily unreachable
    // database must not prevent the app from starting: log and continue —
    // /sync requests fail until the schema exists (restart once the database
    // is reachable, or run the DDL from a deploy step).
    let schema_backend = Arc::clone(&backend);
    match tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || schema_backend.ensure_schema()).await {
        Ok(Ok(())) => {}
        Ok(Err(e)) => {
            eprintln!("offline-sync: could not ensure the sync schema (/sync will fail): {e}");
        }
        Err(e) => eprintln!("offline-sync: sync schema task failed: {e}"),
    }
    app.nest(
        "/sync",
        server::router(backend, Arc::new(LwwResolver))
            .layer(axum::middleware::from_fn(require_sync_auth)),
    )
}
```

`ensure_schema()` creates the shadow tables (`autumn_sync_rows`,
`autumn_sync_applied`, `autumn_sync_horizons`) idempotently. They are
deliberately **not** part of autumn's framework migrations — apps without
offline sync see zero schema churn. Rows and push-dedup records carry a
`scope` column partitioning data per tenant — the single-tenant mount
above stores everything under the constant `"global"` scope (see "Scope
data per user" below).

### Authentication on `/sync` is built in and fail closed

The `/sync` endpoints trust `device_id` as sent, and **anyone who can
reach them can read and write every synced row** — so unlike a page route,
the generated mount refuses to run open. `mount_offline_sync` above only
nests `/sync` when the deployment sets `SYNC_TOKEN` (a long random
secret), and it wraps the router in this generated middleware — a
bearer-token check with two fail-closed properties: an unset/empty
expected token rejects with `500` rather than matching an empty
`Authorization: Bearer ` header, and the comparison is constant-time
(`autumn_web::sync::server::constant_time_token_eq`, built on the same
`subtle` primitive autumn's webhook signature checks use) so response
timing cannot leak the secret byte by byte:

<!-- drift:src/lib.rs -->
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "offline-sync")]
async fn require_sync_auth(
    request: autumn_web::reexports::axum::extract::Request,
    next: autumn_web::reexports::axum::middleware::Next,
) -> Result<
    autumn_web::reexports::axum::response::Response,
    autumn_web::reexports::axum::http::StatusCode,
> {
    use autumn_web::reexports::axum::http;

    // Fail CLOSED when the server is misconfigured: with an unset/empty
    // SYNC_TOKEN the expected value would be "" and a bare
    // `Authorization: Bearer ` header would authenticate.
    let expected = std::env::var("SYNC_TOKEN").unwrap_or_default();
    if expected.is_empty() {
        return Err(http::StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
    let authorized = request
        .headers()
        .get(http::header::AUTHORIZATION)
        .and_then(|value| value.to_str().ok())
        .and_then(|value| value.strip_prefix("Bearer "))
        .is_some_and(|token| autumn_web::sync::server::constant_time_token_eq(token, &expected));
    if authorized {
        Ok(next.run(request).await)
    } else {
        Err(http::StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED)
    }
}
```

A shared token authenticates the *deployment's devices*, not individual
users — the generated single-tenant default. Apps with real accounts
should swap the token check inside `require_sync_auth` for their own
session/token validation (the router is a plain `axum::Router`, so any
tower/axum middleware works; `AppBuilder::nest` also applies your
app-level global middleware to the nested router). Whatever you swap in,
**keep it fail closed**: reject when the check cannot be performed, never
fall through to allowing the request. And serve `/sync` over HTTPS only —
the bearer token and every synced row travel in these requests.

On the device side, the generated shell sends the matching credential
automatically: `start_background_sync` (next section) reads
`AUTUMN_SYNC__TOKEN` and sets `SyncConfig::bearer_token`, which the engine
sends as `Authorization: Bearer …`. Non-Tauri clients wire it directly:

```rust
let mut config = autumn_web::sync::SyncConfig::new(remote_url);
config.bearer_token = Some(load_user_token()); // sent as Authorization: Bearer …
let engine = autumn_web::sync::SyncEngine::new(store, config);
```

This end-to-end wiring — guarded router rejects a token-less engine,
accepts a configured one — is pinned by the
`bearer_token_authenticates_against_a_guarded_router` integration test.

### Scope data per user (multi-user apps)

> **Warning — the default mount is single-tenant.** `server::router`
> stores every synced row in one shared `"global"` scope: **any**
> authenticated user reads and writes **all** synced data. That is correct
> for a single-user/local deployment (one person's devices sharing one
> data set) and wrong for anything with accounts. Authentication alone
> does not partition data — `device_id` identifies an installation, not
> an account, and the server trusts it as sent.

Multi-user deployments mount `server::scoped_router` instead and derive a
**scope** — the key partitioning rows, tombstones, and push-dedup records
— from the authenticated principal. The scope is **never client-supplied**
(the wire protocol carries no scope field, so a client cannot name another
user's partition): auth middleware inserts an
`autumn_web::sync::SyncScope` request extension once the credential has
been verified. Extending `require_sync_auth` from above:

```rust
use autumn_web::sync::SyncScope;

async fn require_sync_auth(
    mut request: axum::extract::Request,
    next: Next,
) -> Result<axum::response::Response, StatusCode> {
    // ... the fail-closed token validation from the previous section,
    //     yielding the authenticated user ...
    let user_id = authenticated_user_id.ok_or(StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED)?;
    // Attach the scope of the user the CREDENTIAL proved — never a value
    // taken from the request body or query.
    request
        .extensions_mut()
        .insert(SyncScope::new(format!("user:{user_id}")));
    Ok(next.run(request).await)
}

// In serve(), swap the single-tenant constructor for the scoped one:
//     app.nest(
//         "/sync",
//         server::scoped_router(backend, Arc::new(LwwResolver))
//             .layer(middleware::from_fn(require_sync_auth)),
//     )
```

Under a scoped mount, the same `(collection, pk)` written by two users is
two independent rows: pulls return only the requesting user's rows,
pushes can never read or modify another user's data, and retried pushes
dedup within their own scope. `scoped_router` keeps the same fail-closed
posture as the token check: a request that reaches it without a
`SyncScope` extension (misconfigured middleware) is rejected with `500`
and touches nothing — falling back to a shared scope would silently merge
users' data. This wiring is pinned end-to-end by the
`scoped_router_partitions_data_by_authenticated_principal` integration
test.

**Client side — one installation, many accounts.** The local `SyncStore`
is one SQLite file per installation. When the same device can
re-authenticate as a different account (logout/login, token rotation),
bind the store to the signed-in account and reset on change:

```rust
// On every login — and, to wipe eagerly at logout, with a sentinel:
store.set_identity(&format!("user:{user_id}"))?;
```

`set_identity` compares against the identity persisted in the store and,
when it changed, drops the cached rows, local tombstones, pending outbox,
and cursor in one transaction — so the next account starts from a clean
first sync instead of (1) reading the previous account's cached rows
before ever pulling, or (2) inheriting a cursor that silently skips its
own lower-versioned rows (versions come from one global sequence across
scopes). Pending edits belong to the outgoing account and are
deliberately dropped — sync before switching if they must survive. The
identity is your auth layer's client-side key; it does not need to equal
the server-side scope string (which is derived from auth on the server
and never client-supplied), it only has to change whenever the account
does. Never calling `set_identity` keeps today's single-user behavior.

### The shell: local store + background engine

`src-tauri/Cargo.toml` gains a direct `autumn-web` dependency with the
`offline-sync` feature, **mirroring the app's own dependency source** so
cargo unifies both edges into one crate instance: a registry version stays
a version (with any `[patch.crates-io]` override of `autumn-web` from the
app's manifest — or its workspace root — copied into the shell manifest,
since the shell declares its own `[workspace]` and would otherwise ignore
the patch), a `path` dependency is recomputed relative to `src-tauri/`, and
a `git` dependency keeps its `rev`/`branch`/`tag`. When the source cannot
be represented, the generator warns and falls back to the registry — edit
the `autumn-web` entry in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` by hand in that case.
`setup()` places the sync database in the app sandbox
and exports its path for your routes:

<!-- drift:src-tauri/src/lib.rs -->
```rust
    let sync_db = data_root.join("sync.db");
    std::env::set_var("AUTUMN_SYNC__DB_PATH", sync_db.to_string_lossy().as_ref());
```

The server thread starts the engine before parking on `serve()`:

<!-- drift:src-tauri/src/lib.rs -->
```rust
fn start_background_sync(runtime: &tokio::runtime::Runtime, sync_db: std::path::PathBuf) {
    let store = match autumn_web::sync::SyncStore::open(&sync_db) {
        Ok(store) => store,
        Err(e) => {
            // ... log and return — the app still runs, without sync ...
            return;
        }
    };
    let Ok(remote_url) = std::env::var("AUTUMN_SYNC__REMOTE_URL") else {
        // ... log: offline-only mode (local SyncStore, no background sync) ...
        return;
    };
    let mut config = autumn_web::sync::SyncConfig::new(remote_url);
    match std::env::var("AUTUMN_SYNC__TOKEN") {
        Ok(token) if !token.is_empty() => config.bearer_token = Some(token),
        _ => // ... warn: uncredentialed — the fail-closed server mount answers 401 ...
    }
    let engine = autumn_web::sync::SyncEngine::new(store, config);
    // spawn_background must be entered from inside the runtime; the returned
    // JoinHandle detaches on drop (dropping never cancels the task).
    let _sync_task =
        runtime.block_on(async { engine.spawn_background(std::time::Duration::from_secs(30)) });
    let _ = SYNC_KICK.set((runtime.handle().clone(), engine));
}
```

And the tauri run loop gains a **connectivity-regain trigger**: mobile OSes
freeze the process (and its timers) in the background, and connectivity
usually returns together with the foreground — so an app resume kicks one
immediate sync pass instead of waiting out the interval/backoff:

<!-- drift:src-tauri/src/lib.rs -->
```rust
            if let tauri::RunEvent::Resumed = event {
                if let Some((handle, engine)) = SYNC_KICK.get() {
                    let engine = engine.clone();
                    handle.spawn(async move {
                        if let Err(e) = engine.sync_once().await {
                            // ... log; the background loop retries anyway ...
                        }
                    });
                }
            }
```

### Offline startup, by construction

The offline requirement — *"the app functions fully offline"* (for
`SyncStore` data) — is met by **not giving the device a database at all**.
With no database in the resolved config (on a device there are no config
files and `AUTUMN_DATABASE__URL` is unset), autumn's boot takes the
"Database not configured" path: no pool, no
startup migrations, nothing to time out. Every piece of the sync wiring
degrades instead of aborting: a missing remote URL means offline-only mode,
an unreachable remote is a retried transport error, and the (server-side)
schema DDL failure logs and continues. Contrast this with the default
`tauri-mobile` model, where a dev-profile build with an unreachable
database exits during startup migrations — under `--offline-sync` that path
is never armed on the device. If you *do* set a database URL on the device
(hybrid: some direct-Postgres routes plus offline collections), you have
reintroduced that startup dependency knowingly.

## 7. Offline showcase: a notes flow, verified in airplane mode

The scaffold wires the plumbing; here is the complete pattern for an
offline-capable feature. Routes talk to the `SyncStore` — reads and writes
work with the radio off:

```rust
use std::sync::OnceLock;

use autumn_web::prelude::*;
use autumn_web::sync::SyncStore;

#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
struct Note {
    title: String,
    body: String,
}

/// The app's one `SyncStore`, opened lazily at the path the mobile shell
/// exported. Open ONCE and clone per use — clones share one connection;
/// opening per request would create a new connection (and pay schema
/// setup) every time.
fn notes_store() -> SyncStore {
    static STORE: OnceLock<SyncStore> = OnceLock::new();
    STORE
        .get_or_init(|| {
            let path = std::env::var("AUTUMN_SYNC__DB_PATH")
                .unwrap_or_else(|_| "tmp/sync.db".to_owned());
            SyncStore::open(path).expect("failed to open the offline sync store")
        })
        .clone()
}

#[get("/notes")]
async fn notes_index() -> maud::Markup {
    let notes: Vec<(String, Note)> = notes_store().list("notes").unwrap_or_default();
    maud::html! {
        h1 { "Notes (" (notes.len()) ")" }
        ul {
            @for (pk, note) in &notes {
                li { b { (note.title) } " — " (note.body) " [" (pk) "]" }
            }
        }
    }
}

#[post("/notes")]
async fn notes_create(form: Form<Note>) -> Redirect {
    // Client-generated pk — NEVER a serial id: offline devices must be able
    // to create rows concurrently without colliding.
    let pk = uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    notes_store().put("notes", &pk, &*form).expect("local write failed");
    Redirect::to("/notes")
}
```

(Register both in `routes![...]`, and add `uuid = { version = "1",
features = ["v4"] }` to your app's dependencies — any collision-free
string scheme works for `pk`.)

**Airplane-mode checklist** (simulator or device):

1. Deploy the app to a server with `AUTUMN_DATABASE__URL` **and**
   `SYNC_TOKEN` (a long random secret) set — without the token the
   fail-closed mount skips `/sync` entirely. Confirm
   `GET https://your-host/sync/pull?cursor=0` answers `401` bare and JSON
   with `-H "Authorization: Bearer $SYNC_TOKEN"`.
2. Set `AUTUMN_SYNC__REMOTE_URL` and `AUTUMN_SYNC__TOKEN` (the same
   secret) in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, then
   `cd src-tauri && cargo tauri ios dev` (or `android dev`).
3. Create a few notes — they appear instantly (local SQLite writes).
4. **Enable airplane mode.** Create, edit, and delete notes: everything
   keeps working — reads and writes never touch the network. Relaunch the
   app in airplane mode: the data is still there (it is on disk, not in a
   cache). The console shows the engine backing off with transport errors.
5. **Disable airplane mode.** Within the sync interval (or immediately, on
   an app resume) the journal drains: verify on the server with
   `SELECT collection, pk, payload, deleted FROM autumn_sync_rows` — your
   offline creations are rows, your offline deletes are tombstones.
6. Run the app on a second device/simulator: it pulls the first device's
   notes; edits converge both ways, conflicts settle per §4.

In-repo, the same end-to-end behavior is pinned by
`autumn`'s `offline_writes_replay_to_server_on_sync` integration test
(offline writes → server starts → one sync → converged backend, drained
journal) — run
`cargo test -p autumn-web --features offline-sync --test integration_tests offline_sync`.

## 8. Failure modes and limitations

- **Only `SyncStore` data is offline.** Existing diesel `#[repository]`
  repositories and `Db`-extractor queries still need the remote database and
  will fail without it — the honest scope of this feature is "data you put
  in the store", not transparent offline for the whole ORM. Design the
  offline surface of your app around collections.
- **At-least-once, not exactly-once side effects.** Change *application* is
  deduplicated, but if you attach server-side hooks to sync data, make them
  idempotent.
- **Schema evolution is your contract.** Payloads are JSON: evolve models
  additively with serde defaults. There is no payload migration machinery.
- **Long-offline clients** past the GC horizon get a transparent full
  resync (§5) — correct, but bandwidth-shaped like a first sync.
- **Auth is required, not optional**: the `/sync` endpoints trust
  `device_id` as sent — unguarded they expose read/write access to every
  synced row. The generated mount therefore **fails closed**: without
  `SYNC_TOKEN` it does not mount `/sync` at all, and with it every request
  must present the matching bearer token (§6; devices send
  `AUTUMN_SYNC__TOKEN`). Don't weaken that posture when you swap in your
  own auth, and never expose the endpoints without TLS.
  **Multi-user apps must also partition data per user**:
  the generated mount is single-tenant (one shared scope) — swap it for
  `server::scoped_router` with a `SyncScope` derived from the
  authenticated user (§6, "Scope data per user").
- **Clock skew** only influences the default LWW resolver's choice between
  two conflicting writes; feed ordering is immune. If that is still too
  much trust, ship a custom resolver.
- **Storage**: sync.db lives in the app sandbox and is not size-managed by
  the framework. Local tombstones are pruned automatically once the
  server's tombstone GC passes them (until you run `gc_tombstones` they
  are retained — small rows, but yours to bound). While the device is
  offline the pending journal grows with the number of **distinct rows
  touched** (entries per `(collection, pk)` coalesce, so a thousand edits
  of one note stay one journal entry) and drains on the first successful
  sync. On the server, pair `gc_tombstones` with `gc_applied` so the
  dedup table stays bounded too.
- `autumn destroy tauri-mobile --offline-sync` removes the shell; the app
  crate's `offline-sync` feature and the sync code in `src/lib.rs` are left
  in place (like the `serve()` extraction, they remain valid app code).
